-I haven't programmed that path yet.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.920
Right. So a lot of paths then?

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.520
Well, yes,
if it's going to be like the book.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.320
A lot of divergent realities in that book.

No.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.520
I mean, yes,

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.400

You know, just me. At home.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.560
At home. On your own?

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.480
Yeah, it's just that it's all in my head,

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.840

Parallel realities.

-Who's there?

Just give me a sign.

Come on. If there's someone there,
just give me a sign.

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.440
Will you give me a sign?

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:41.280
I know there's someone there.
Just give me a fucking sign.

Well, tell me anyway.

-Yes, please.

So, you're being controlled
by someone on Netflix.

-What is Netflix? Is it a planet?
-I don't know, it...

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:41.600
It's some sort
of future entertainment thing.

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.280
-Like a computer game?
-I don't know.

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:48.680
It's from the 21st Century, they said.

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:52.400
OK, well,
let's try to pick it apart logically,

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:56.160
to see if we can define
if this is reality or delusion.

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:59.720
-It's not a delusion.
-OK, let's go through it.

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.200
OK.

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:08.120
So all of this is happening
to entertain someone.

-Someone who's controlling you.
-Uh-huh.

So why aren't you
in a more entertaining scenario?

-Well, look at you.

[Colin] People think there's one reality

but there's loads of them,
all snaking off, like roots.

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:24.440
And what we do on one path
affects what happens on the other paths.

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:26.320
Time is a construct.

People think you can't go back

but you can, that's what flashbacks are,

they're invitations to go back
and make different choices.

When you make a decision,
you think it's you doing it, but it's not.

It's the spirit out there
that's connected to our world

the whole thing's a metaphor,

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.040
he thinks he's got free will
but really he's trapped in a maze,

00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:12.200
in a system, all he can do is consume,

00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:14.600
he's pursued by demons
that are probably just in his own head,

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:17.680
and even if he does manage to escape
by slipping out one side of the maze,

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:20.120
what happens?
He comes right back in the other side.

it's real and we live in it.

where you can and where you can't go.

I've set you free.

affect the whole that matters.

proper justice. The book.

and that works best when it's one mind.

-You've got mince juice on your hands.

Yes.

So, how does it work then?
Do you go into their office, or...?

01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:01.480
No, I write it here.

to work on something like this?

I believe you called him.

-I don't know. It was too...
-Too?

01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:16.320
Good to be true.

01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:21.120
-I said no.
-You said "no"?

01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:23.240
Well, not to the whole thing,

01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:25.880
just to working there
and being under their control.

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:27.800
I don't know where it came from,

01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:29.920
I just said "no"
and then had to justify it

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.120
by saying that I prefer to work alone.

01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:36.760
But I just don't know
where the urge to say it came from.

01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:41.400
It sounds like you're growing
in confidence. I think it's a good sign.

01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:45.360
Well, they're still letting me
do the game, so...

I don't see why I need
to keep coming to these sessions.

It just feels like being,
I don't know, monitored.

01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:26.760
Perhaps you're feeling intruded upon
because of the anniversary looming.

01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:31.560
It's a difficult time of year for you.
We can't underestimate that.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.800
Would you like to talk
about what happened with your mother?

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:45.880
It can be helpful to revisit things.
Even if you feel you've done this before.

01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:50.760
You might discover something new.

02:35:48.480 --> 02:35:52.120

I know I can squeeze this path in.

02:36:19.040 --> 02:36:21.680
-It's complicated enough.
-Just the weekend. Please.

-That's what you do, is it?

Look, just let him be.

You shouldn't rush him.
He needs to explore all possibilities.

04:04:19.800 --> 04:04:23.320
but I'm a victim, too.
Let's try to not forget that.

04:04:23.400 --> 04:04:27.560
[Crispin] <i>But there's another Tuckersoft</i>
<i>protégé at the center of a mystery.</i>

04:04:27.920 --> 04:04:30.920
<i>Famed programmer Colin Ritman</i>
<i>is still missing,</i>

04:04:31.000 --> 04:04:34.840
<i>having vanished without trace</i>
<i>shortly before the killings.</i>

04:04:35.160 --> 04:04:37.640
<i>At the trial,</i>
<i>Butler denied any involvement</i>

04:04:37.720 --> 04:04:39.960
<i>in Ritman's sudden disappearance,</i>

04:04:40.040 --> 04:04:44.320
<i>claiming he had seen Ritman</i>
<i>committing suicide in a vision.</i>

04:04:44.520 --> 04:04:47.720
<i>Today, Tuckersoft closed its doors</i>
<i>for good.</i>

04:04:47.800 --> 04:04:50.800
<i>And there was no sign of Bandersnatch.</i>

[knocking at door]

04:05:45.520 --> 04:05:46.800
Well, you need a hand.

04:05:50.560 --> 04:05:52.360
Come on, lead me to it.

04:05:53.800 --> 04:05:56.640
-To what?
-Bandersnatch.

04:05:57.240 --> 04:05:59.160
Where's your pit? Up there?

04:06:09.040 --> 04:06:10.480
[Colin] Fucking hell.

04:06:11.080 --> 04:06:12.920
You've gone right down the hole, mate.

04:06:13.800 --> 04:06:15.040
Right down it.

04:06:22.360 --> 04:06:23.480
I killed my dad.

04:06:25.560 --> 04:06:26.680
Right.

04:06:29.720 --> 04:06:32.160
So are you gonna let me go,
or are you gonna kill me?

04:06:39.040 --> 04:06:40.400
I mean, it's your choice.

04:06:41.440 --> 04:06:43.320
In as much as you have any choice.

04:06:46.920 --> 04:06:47.760
I'm sorry.

04:06:49.040 --> 04:06:52.120
Alright. No point arguing about it.

04:06:52.600 --> 04:06:54.280
Not with that though. They sting.

04:06:56.320 --> 04:06:57.560
You got anything blunt?

04:07:01.840 --> 04:07:03.400
Stun me first.

04:07:04.000 --> 04:07:05.360
Bit more humane.

04:07:16.120 --> 04:07:17.040
Try this.

04:07:23.080 --> 04:07:24.040
[thud]

04:07:27.080 --> 04:07:28.600
See you in the next life, yeah?

04:07:38.720 --> 04:07:40.080
Come on, on me head.

04:07:41.080 --> 04:07:41.920
[thud]

04:07:46.480 --> 04:07:48.160
That really is fascinating.

04:07:48.240 --> 04:07:51.000
Although we've got many years to go
before virtual reality

04:07:51.080 --> 04:07:52.920
becomes actual reality.

04:07:53.400 --> 04:07:55.280
-Crispin.
-Thanks, Leslie.

04:07:56.000 --> 04:07:59.600
Now, six months ago,
we were shocked to hear of the murder

04:07:59.680 --> 04:08:02.200
of famed programmer Colin Ritman,

04:08:02.280 --> 04:08:06.200
creator of Metl Hedd, Nohzdyve,
and many other games.

04:08:06.280 --> 04:08:09.000
Today, his murderer is behind bars.

04:08:09.080 --> 04:08:11.240
But could the crime have been prevented?

04:08:11.840 --> 04:08:15.080

No, I'm alright. Thanks, though.

Just thought I'd give you the choice.

04:11:02.040 --> 04:11:05.320
-Don't forget your tea.
-Cheers.

04:11:32.880 --> 04:11:34.160
What have you done?

04:11:36.200 --> 04:11:37.640
I chose for you.

04:11:39.840 --> 04:11:41.080
Are you OK with that?

04:11:42.280 --> 04:11:44.440
Yeah. [laughs]

04:11:48.640 --> 04:11:50.920
[laughs]

04:12:12.120 --> 04:12:13.880
[Colin] People think there's one reality

04:12:13.960 --> 04:12:16.200
but there's loads of them,
all snaking off, like roots.

04:12:16.280 --> 04:12:18.920
And what you do on one path
affects what happens on the other paths.

04:12:19.160 --> 04:12:20.840
Time is a construct.

04:12:20.920 --> 04:12:24.040
People think you can't go back
and change things, but you can.

04:12:24.120 --> 04:12:25.400
That's what flashbacks are.

04:12:25.480 --> 04:12:28.360
They're invitations to go back
and make different choices.

04:12:28.440 --> 04:12:31.440
When you make a decision,
you think it's you doing it, but it's not.

04:12:31.520 --> 04:12:34.280
It's the spirit out there
that's connected to our world

04:12:34.480 --> 04:12:38.680
that decides what we do
and we just have to go along for the ride.

04:12:39.720 --> 04:12:41.720
Mirrors let you move through time.

04:12:42.200 --> 04:12:43.440
The government monitors people,

04:12:44.040 --> 04:12:46.040
they pay people to pretend
to be your relatives,

04:12:46.560 --> 04:12:49.240
and they put drugs in your food
and they film you

04:12:49.720 --> 04:12:51.520
There's messages in every game.

04:12:51.800 --> 04:12:54.240
Like Pac-Man,
do you know what PAC stands for?

04:12:55.160 --> 04:12:57.480
P-A-C. Program and Control.

04:12:57.560 --> 04:12:59.400
He's Program and Control Man.

04:13:00.440 --> 04:13:01.400
The whole thing's a metaphor.

04:13:01.680 --> 04:13:04.520
He thinks he's got free will
but really, he's trapped in a maze,

04:13:04.760 --> 04:13:06.720
in a system, all he can do is consume,

04:13:06.800 --> 04:13:09.080
he's pursued by demons
that are probably just in his own head.

04:13:09.440 --> 04:13:12.160
And even if he does manage to escape
by slipping out one side of the maze,

04:13:12.440 --> 04:13:14.600
what happens?
He comes right back in the other side.

04:13:15.200 --> 04:13:16.480
People think it's a happy game,

04:13:16.720 --> 04:13:19.520
it's not a happy game,
it's a fucking nightmare world

04:13:19.600 --> 04:13:22.000
and the worst thing is
it's real and we live in it.

04:13:22.320 --> 04:13:23.160
It's all a code.

04:13:23.880 --> 04:13:26.040
If you listen closely,
you can hear the numbers.

04:13:27.680 --> 04:13:30.280
There's a cosmic flowchart
that dictates where you can

04:13:30.760 --> 04:13:32.360
and where you can't go.

04:13:33.680 --> 04:13:36.640
I've given you the knowledge.
I've set you free.

04:13:38.920 --> 04:13:40.040
Do you understand?

04:13:42.280 --> 04:13:43.200
Maybe.

04:13:44.720 --> 04:13:46.440
Yes. Sort of.

04:13:46.800 --> 04:13:48.320
I'll show you what I mean.

04:13:49.680 --> 04:13:50.520
Come with me.

04:13:59.240 --> 04:14:00.880
We're on one path.

04:14:01.560 --> 04:14:03.160
Right now, me and you.

04:14:04.040 --> 04:14:06.640
And how one path ends is immaterial.

04:14:06.880 --> 04:14:12.560
It's how our decisions along that path
affect the whole that matters.

04:14:13.240 --> 04:14:14.440
Do you believe me?

04:14:15.640 --> 04:14:19.760
-[sniggers] I don't know.
-I'll prove it.

04:14:20.640 --> 04:14:23.880
One of us is going over.

04:14:25.280 --> 04:14:26.320
Over there.

04:14:30.680 --> 04:14:31.800
You'd die. You'd die.

04:14:32.560 --> 04:14:36.680
It wouldn't matter
because there are other timelines, Stefan.

04:14:37.400 --> 04:14:39.640
How many times have you watched
Pac-Man die?

04:14:40.400 --> 04:14:41.720
Doesn't bother him.

04:14:42.960 --> 04:14:44.400
He just tries again.

04:14:45.280 --> 04:14:46.680
One of us is jumping.

04:14:47.560 --> 04:14:48.920
So, who's it going to be?

04:14:54.520 --> 04:14:56.200
There's a nice breeze up here.

04:14:59.560 --> 04:15:00.560
So come on.

04:15:02.040 --> 04:15:03.560
Which one of us is jumping?

04:15:11.440 --> 04:15:14.560
So, that's how
the wireframe models of today

04:15:14.640 --> 04:15:17.760
might provide the Hollywood entertainment
of the future.

04:15:17.960 --> 04:15:20.160
-Crispin.
-Thanks, Leslie.

04:15:20.840 --> 04:15:24.800
Now, yesterday, following weeks
of controversy and speculation,

04:15:24.880 --> 04:15:28.880
games company Tuckersoft announced
it's going into administration.

04:15:28.960 --> 04:15:30.200
<i>So, what went wrong?</i>

04:15:30.840 --> 04:15:34.000

04:15:40.840 --> 04:15:43.000
But Bandersnatch never appeared,

04:15:43.080 --> 04:15:46.560
following the arrest and subsequent
murder charge against its creator,

04:15:46.640 --> 04:15:49.040
<i>19-year-old Stefan Butler,</i>

<i>of murdering his father</i>

04:15:51.520 --> 04:15:53.520
<i>following a psychological breakdown.</i>

04:15:53.600 --> 04:15:56.080
<i>This has raised questions</i>
<i>about the judgment</i>

04:15:56.160 --> 04:15:59.000
<i>of Tuckersoft boss, Mohan Thakur.</i>

04:15:59.480 --> 04:16:02.320
It was his idea to do it alone.
His decision.

04:16:02.400 --> 04:16:04.160
I wasn't to know he couldn't hack it.

04:16:04.520 --> 04:16:08.040
I mean, I know his dad's dead,
rest his soul,

04:16:08.400 --> 04:16:12.040
but I'm a victim, too.
Let's try to not forget that.

04:16:12.480 --> 04:16:16.520
[Crispin] <i>Another Tuckersoft protégé,</i>
<i>famed programmer Colin Ritman,</i>

04:16:16.600 --> 04:16:21.040
<i>believes there are important lessons</i>
<i>to be learned from Butler's unravelling.</i>

04:16:21.600 --> 04:16:24.160
What would you say to Stefan,
if he could hear you?

04:16:25.320 --> 04:16:26.800
I'd say try again.

04:16:27.760 --> 04:16:28.840
But he's in prison.

04:16:29.880 --> 04:16:31.560
