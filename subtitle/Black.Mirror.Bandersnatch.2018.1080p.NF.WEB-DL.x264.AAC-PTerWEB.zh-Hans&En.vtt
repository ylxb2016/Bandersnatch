NETFLIX 原创剧集

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
剧名：潘达斯奈基

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.520
（1984年7月9日）

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
吃早餐吗？
Breakfast?

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.480
你的茶
Here's your tea.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.680
都不说声谢谢
"Thanks, Dad."

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.960
抱歉 在想其他事情 需要为今天准备就绪
Sorry. Sorry, I was miles away. Got to get everything ready for today.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.040
跟一些搞电脑的家伙？
This with some computer people?

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.960
对 塔克软件 他们做科林·里特曼的游戏
Yeah. Tuckersoft. They do Colin Ritman's games.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.560
不会是那个著名的科林·里特曼吧
Oh, not the Colin Ritman.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.240
公司主人塔克尔先生
Mr. Thakur, the owner,

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.080
说我可以演示一下潘达斯奈基
said I could show them my Bandersnatch demo.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.120
-潘达什么？  -潘达斯奈基
-Your Bander-what?  -Bandersnatch.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.920
我是根据一本书改编的
I've based it on the book.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.280
（《潘达斯奈基》 杰罗姆·F·戴维斯著）

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.600
是你母亲的书吧？
Was that your mother's?

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.360
对 在她的东西里面
It was in her things, yeah.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.400
-不知道她读没读过  -应该没有
-Don't know if she read it though.  -Don't think so.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.400
“杰罗姆·F·戴维斯”
"Jerome F. Davies."

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.360
肯定不是一位好作家
Well, he can't be a great writer.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.280
你一直都在跳来跳去地看
You're always flicking backwards and forwards in that.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.120
不是的 这本书是“选择自己的冒险”
No, it's a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.000
你来决定你的角色怎么做
You decide what your character does.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.080
像游戏一样
-You know, like a game.  -Sounds thrilling.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.120
听着挺让人激动

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.120
你来决定早餐想吃什么 如何？
How about you decide what you want for your breakfast?

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.160
（白糖沙翁 香甜玉米片）

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.400
两种我都觉得太小儿科 但你肯定坚持要吃
Both seem a bit kiddywink to me, but you will insist.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.840
喂
Oi!

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.760
回隔壁屋去！
Get back next door!

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.440
是隔壁那条该死的猎犬
The bloody hound from next door.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.760
走啊
Go on!

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.960
真是烦死人了
Be the death of us.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.080
（汤姆森双胞胎乐团《入沟》 《这才叫音乐·二》）

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.720
（朋友）

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.800
（塔克软件）
Hello, Tuckersoft.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.440
漂亮 干得好 萨特帕尔
Oh, beautiful. Nice one, Satpal.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.880
去买本森香烟 还有巧克力棒
Alright, fetch us 20 B&amp;H, would you? And... Lion bar.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.720
好孩子
Good boy.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.760
你就是斯蒂文
You... are... Steven.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.200
-是斯蒂芬  -斯蒂芬 抱歉
-Stefan.  -Stefan, sorry, mate.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.400
没事 大家总是会叫错
That's alright. I get it all the time.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.640
抱歉有点乱 我们周一刚搬来
Sorry about the chaos. We just moved in Monday.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.560
地方很大
It's big.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.040
扩张 就是我的计划
Well, expansion, that's my plan.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.680
想想 一整个团队 只做图像
Imagine, OK. A whole team just for graphics,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.080
这边团队做声音 那边做情节
another for sound, for gameplay.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.400
我们会成为热门产品工厂 就像电脑游戏界的摩城唱片
We're going to be a hit factory. Like Motown but for computer games.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.560
这话 你是第一个听到的人
You heard it here first.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.720
（金属头）

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.520
这是科林的新作
That's Colin's new one.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.640
-科林·里特曼？  -他就在那
-Colin Ritman?  -That's him over there.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.840
太疯狂了 他的游戏我都玩过
That's crazy. I've played all of his games.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.040
去打个招呼吧
Let's say hello.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.840
-他在工作 确定他不介意吗？  -没事的
-Sure he won't mind? He's working.  -He'll be fine. He'll be fine. Shh! Shh!

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.720
等等
Oh. Wait, wait, wait.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.360
听什么呢 卡加咕咕乐团？
What's this, Kajagoogoo?

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.000
怎么可能
You wish.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.240
看看他这状态 今年赚的钱都够买兰博基尼了
The state of him, he's made enough this year to buy a Lamborghini

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.120
但还是抽自己卷的烟
and he still smokes roll-ups.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.840
外面卖的卷烟都有士的宁 闹笑话的人是他
Well, pre-rolled has strychnine in them, so the joke's on him.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.000
随便了 这位是斯蒂芬…
Anyway, this is Stefan, er...

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.960
巴特勒
Butler, Butler.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.320
我是科林
I'm Colin, yeah?

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.640
嗯 我玩过你所有游戏 全部所有
Yeah, I've played all of your games. All of them.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.320
除了康懋达电脑上的那些 我没有康懋达电脑
Except the Commodore ones, I don't... don't have a Commodore.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.280
-康懋达电脑声卡不错  -是啊
Great sound chip, the Commodore. Yeah.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.200
这是我最新的游戏
This is my latest.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.320
（运行）

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.040
叫鼻子跳水
It's called Nohzdyve.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.360
-游戏界面真流畅  -花了一些功夫
-The sprites are so smooth.  -That took some doing.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.440
可恶
Oh, bollocks.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.280
-怎么了？  -缓冲区错误
-What's that?  -It's a buffer error.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.920
显存超了
The eyeballs have overrun the video memory--

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.280
是啊 显存 我正要说呢
Oh, yeah, video memory, yeah. I was going to say that.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.240
这样 说正经事吧
Anyway, listen, let's get down to business.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.720
斯蒂芬要给我们演示点东西
Stefan's got something to demo for us.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.440
厉害了
Bloody hell.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.160
就像三维怪物迷宫？
So it's like 3D Monster Maze?

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.040
不过人是在不断进行选择
Only when you're moving from choice to choice.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.240
-其实是一个探险游戏  -像《霍比特人》
-It's actually an adventure game.  -Like The Hobbit?

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.320
嗯 但不用打字
Yeah, but... without any typing.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.240
不用打字？
Without any typing?

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.600
-所以不会有“找灯”什么的？  -对
So no "get lamp" or whatever? That's right.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.080
屏幕上出现选择 倒计时内确定就行
Choices come up on the screen and you pick one against the clock.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.600
（弱小的人类 要崇拜我吗？）

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.560
他是恶魔帕克斯 是书里的
OK, he's Pax, he's the demon. He's in the book.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.440
我们其实到了一个选择点
So we've actually arrived at a choice point,

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.360
用游戏杆进行选择
and then you can choose with the joystick.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.960
有十秒时间
You've got ten seconds.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.600
崇拜他
Worship him.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.040
不要这样 他是命运的窃贼…
No, don't do that, he's the Thief of Destiny...

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.320
我是说 在书里
in the book, I mean.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.920
我家里有一本 但从没读过
Got a copy of this at home. Never got around to reading it.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.840
你应该读读 杰罗姆·戴维斯是天才
You should. Jerome F. Davies was a genius.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.560
他不是发疯了 砍下了妻子的头吗？
Didn't he go bonkers and cut his wife's head off?

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.880
-是 但我是说除了这点之外…  -不好意思
-Yeah, but, I mean, apart from that-- -Excuse me.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.320
（崇拜帕克斯）

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.880
（超出范围）

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.240
怎么回事？
What's happened?

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.640
这条路的程序我还没写
Well, I haven't programmed that pathway yet.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.120
有很多条路？
Lot of paths then?

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.320
嗯 如果按书里来 就会这样
Well, yeah, if it's going to be like the book.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.560
那你打算怎么办？
So, come on. How do you want to go about this?

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.520
-你感兴趣？  -当然啊
-You're... you're interested?  -That's what I'm saying.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.240
现在是七月 如果要冲击圣诞节
OK, it's July now, so if we want to hit Christmas,

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.880
那我们在十一月就要投入生产
then we'll need the tapes in Smiths by November.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.760
我的提议是 你来这里写程序
OK. So here's my proposal. Come and write it here.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.080
-这里？  -对啊
-Here?  -Yeah!

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.840
我们专门为你安排几张桌子 建一个小团队
We'll give you a couple of desks, set up a small team, just for you.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.000
当然 科林也在附近
And of course Col's on hand.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.760
你怎么想？
What do you reckon?

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.280
对了 我下周会雇用一个做声卡的
Oh, and hey, I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.160
所以音乐我们可以解决 全在公司内部做
so music we can take care of. All in-house.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.560
说吧 你怎么看？
So, come on. What's your answer?

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:03.960
好
Yes.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.600
完美
Perfect. Perfect.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.720
好 第一件事就是稍微精简一下项目
OK, so the first thing we need to do is streamline the project a little.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.720
做一整本书 体量太大
We can't fit a breeze block of a book into 48K.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.120
看呐
Oh, look at this.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.560
给
Here you go.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.080
祝我生日快乐
Happy Birthday to me.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.120
抱歉 哥们 选错路了
Sorry, mate. Wrong path.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.320
（五个月后）
The next game under our Christmas spotlight is Bandersnatch,

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.320
我们关注的下一个 圣诞游戏是潘达斯奈基

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.960
游戏根据杰罗姆·戴维斯的 同名书籍改编
in which the player navigates a shifting timeline of parallel realities,

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.520
玩家在各种平行现实的时间线上行进
based on the book of the same name by Jerome F. Davies.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.960
（潘达斯奈基 （塔克软件 6.95英镑））

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.520
这就是潘达斯奈基游戏原理 但它夺得你的尊重了吗？
That's how Bandersnatch works, but did it "snatch" your respect?

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.040
恐怕没有 莱斯莉
I'm afraid not, Leslie,

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.600
原因很简单 游戏太短
for the simple reason that it's just way too short.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.400
还没开始就算结束了
It's over before it's even begun.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.320
这是塔克软件第一款团队创造的游戏
This is the one of the first team-created games from Tuckersoft,

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.880
我觉得 很像是通过 制作委员会方式做出来的
and I think that's given it a very designed-by-committee feel,

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.840
基本上就是 用最快最简单的方式来吸金
almost like they just rushed out the simplest, quickest cash-in they could.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.840
他们应该从头再来过
What they should've done is just gone right back to the start and tried again.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.160
-你的评定是？  -0颗星 太糟糕了
-And your verdict? -No stars out of five. Terrible.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.520
好吧 也许下周会有更精彩的…
Oof, well, maybe next week we'll have something more for you...

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.400
那孩子什么都不懂
That kid knows nothing.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.360
我应该再试一次
I should try again.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.840
-斯蒂芬？  -我要再试一次
-Stefan.  -I'm trying again.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.720
（1984年7月9日）

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.720
吃早餐吗？
Breakfast?

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.200
-潘达什么？  -潘达斯奈基
-Your Bander-what?  -Bandersnatch.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.360
这本书是“选择自己的冒险”
It's a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.920
隔壁那条该死的猎犬 真是烦死人了
The bloody hound from next door. Be the death of us.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.000
（朋友）

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.720
（塔克软件）

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.640
我们会成为热门产品工厂
We're going to be a hit factory.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.880
科林·里特曼？太疯狂了 我玩过他所有游戏
Colin Ritman? That's crazy. I've played all of his games.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.880
看看他这状态 今年赚的钱都够买兰博基尼了
The state of him. He's made enough this yearÂ to buy a Lamborghini

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.080
但还是抽自己卷的烟
and he still smokes roll-ups.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.600
我们之前见过吗？
We've met before?

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.200
没有
No.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.520
我现在在做这个
This is what I'm working on.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.720
鼻子跳水
Nohzdyve.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.520
没错
Yeah... that's right.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.640
（运行）

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.440
-可恶  -怎么了？
-Oh, bollocks.  -What's that?

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.560
缓冲区错误
Buffer error.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.640
游戏界面超显存了
The eyeball sprite's overshot the video memory.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.200
你怎么知道？
How did you know that?

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.920
-没怎么啊  -我的天 他很优秀吧？
-Just did.  -Bloody hell, he's good, right?

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:51.040
好了 来说正经事 斯蒂芬有东西要演示给我们看
Anyway, let's get down to business. Stefan's got something to demo for us.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.360
用游戏杆做选择 有十秒时间
You choose with the joystick. See. You've got ten seconds.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.320
别崇拜他 他是命运之窃贼
Don't worship him, he's the Thief of Destiny.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.360
-你读过《潘达斯奈基》？  -杰罗姆·戴维斯 太有远见
-You've read Bandersnatch?  -Jerome F. Davies. Visionary.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.920
他就是那个发了疯 把老婆脑袋砍掉的家伙？
Isn't he that bloke who went cuckoo and cut his wife's head off?

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.160
对 大家都倾向于关注这一点
That is what people tend to focus on, yes.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.880
你是哪个结局？读那本书的时候
Which ending did you get? When you read it.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.360
-全部结局  -不好意思
-All of them.  -Excuse me.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:13.760
（崇拜帕克斯）

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.560
-怎么回事？  -这条路的程序我还没写
-What's happened?  -I haven't programmed that path yet.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.920
是哦 有很多条路？
Right. So a lot of paths then?

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.640
对 如果按书里来 就会这样
Well, yes, if it's going to be like the book.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.880
书里有很多不同的现实
A lot of divergent realities in that book.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.480
这本书很超前 因为时间是存在的
It was ahead of its time. In as much as time exists.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.720
好 我的提议是 你来这里写程序
OK. So here's my proposal. Come and write it here.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.680
-这里？  -我们专门为你安排几张桌子
-Here?  -We'll give you a couple of desks,

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.760
建一个小团队 当然 科林也在附近
set up a small team, just for you. And of course Col's on hand.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.920
你怎么想？
What do you reckon?

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.040
对了 我下周会雇用一个做声卡的
Oh, and hey, I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.680
所以音乐我们可以解决 全都内部来做
so music we can take care of. All in-house.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.400
说吧 你怎么看？
So, come on. What's your answer?

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.040
不
No.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:05.040
我的意思是 我确实想做你的游戏 但是…
I mean, yes, I want to do your game, but I-I just...

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.400
我只是觉得我需要…
I just think I need-I need to...

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.760
我需要按自己想法来写
I need to write it how I know.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.360
就我一个人 在家里写
You know, just me. At home.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.920
在家里 你一个人？
At home. On your own?

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.480
对 现在它全在我脑子里
Yeah, it's just that it's all in my head,

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.080
如果让其他人插手
and I think if I let other people in it'll just get, I don't know, stressy?

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.840
可能会有点压力？

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.520
“有点压力”？
"Stressy"?

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:34.320
但我知道自己肯定能做好
But I know that I can do it proper justice.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.440
对得起这本书
The book.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.280
各种不同的故事线 平行现实
You know, divergent story paths. Parallel realities.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.040
-但它也只是个游戏吧？  -我明白
-It's still a game though, yeah?  -I get it.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.160
这小子是个匠人
The lad's a craftsman.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.920
孤独的林中居民 我也是
He's a lone woodsman. I'm the same.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.920
-可是…  -如我所说
-Yeah, but-- -It's like I say,

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.520
团队适合做动作游戏
teams are fine for things like action titles,

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.360
但涉及到玩概念的游戏
but when it's a concept piece,

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:58.240
就需要一点点疯狂 最好是一个人来想
bit of madness is what you need and that works best when it's one mind.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.120
好了 蒂莫西·利里 我们晚点再议论《知觉之门》
Alright, Timothy Leary, we'll debate The Doors of Perception later--

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.600
那是赫胥黎的书 不是利里
That was Huxley not Leary.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.280
如果你要自己写
If you're going toÂ write this on your tod ,the important thing is

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.080
那重要的是 圣诞需要有成品
putting it out for Christmas,Â so I'll need finished code by 12th September.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.680
所以9月12日前要编码完毕

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.640
-好 可以  -不能晚
-OK, sure.  -But no later.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.680
你都听些什么？
What do you listen to?

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.120
以便让自己进入心流
To get in to the flow.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.400
音乐啊？
Oh, music?

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.120
汤姆森双胞胎乐团
Er... Thompson Twins.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.640
拿支笔
Get a pen.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.360
我在解冻肉馅
I'm defrosting mince.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.240
这东西真是黑科技
It's like alien technology, this thing.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.480
情况顺利吗？
Oh. How... How did it go?

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.520
挺好的 很顺利
Er, good. Yeah, really good.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.720
他们收了
-They're taking it.  -Oh, well, that's great, isn't it?

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.880
-太棒了  -是啊

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.920
-很厉害  -你手上有肉汁
-Well done, mate.  -You've got mince juice on your hands.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.880
嗯
Yes.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:17.520
那是怎样安排？ 你去他们办公室还是？
So, how does it work then? Do you go into their office, or...?

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.120
不去 我在这里写
No, I write it here.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.200
-自己一个人？  -嗯
-On-on your own?  -Yes.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.280
这个…
And...

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.280
这种工作这样做好吗？
Is that the best way to work on something like this?

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.680
为什么不好？
Why wouldn't it be?

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.240
画面做得确实很厉害 罗宾
Well, the graphics are certainly impressive, Robin,

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.400
但一个大问题是 玩起来怎么样？
but the big question is, what's it like to play?

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.560
游戏玩法也一样很厉害
Well, the gameplay is just as impressive.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.320
我必须说 这是科林·里特曼的游戏 所以大家期待不低
I must say, this is a Colin Ritman game, so we'd expect little else,

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.200
但哪怕以他的标准来看 这游戏也确实非常好
but even by his standards this is really most impressive.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.080
游戏很有挑战 需要不断学习
It's challenging, there's quite a big learning curve,

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.240
玩家会死很多次 必须多次尝试 但我并不怎么介意
so you die a lot and have to try again but I didn't really mind that much.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.160
（《看门 拿钥匙》）
So it sounds great but what's your verdict, Robin?

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.320
听起来很棒 罗宾 你的评定是？

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.040
满分五星 我给四星 科林·里特曼再次成功了
Four stars out of five. Colin Ritman does it again.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.120
-所以还不够完美  -没有什么是完美无缺的
-So not quite perfect. -Well, nothing's perfect.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.120
我在那里 那边是科林·里特曼…
So there I am, there's Colin Ritman--

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.040
“真正的科林·里特曼” 我记得你是这样说的
"The actual Colin Ritman," I believe you called him.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:21.320
没错 而且塔克尔先生给我机会
Yeah, exactly. And Mr. Thakur's offering me the chance to work there

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.400
可以去他们办公室 在科林身边工作
in their own office alongside Colin.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.360
而我…
And I just...

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.240
-不知道 有点太过…  -太过？
-I don't know. It was too...  -Too?

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.000
太过理想 不像是真的
Good to be true.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.000
-我拒绝了  -你拒绝了？
-I said no.  -You said no?

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.880
不是拒绝一整件事
Well, not to the whole thing,

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.600
只是拒绝去那里工作 在其控制之下
just to working there, being under their control.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.320
不知道为什么 我就说了“不”
I don't know where it came from, I just said no

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.000
然后必须给自己找理由 说自己喜欢独自工作
and then had to justify it by saying that I prefer to work alone.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.600
我只是不知道哪来的那股冲动
But I just don't know where the urge to say it came from.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.040
你听起来越来越自信了 这是好迹象
It sounds like you're growing in confidence. I think it's a good sign.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.000
他们还是让我做游戏 所以…
Well, they're still letting me do the game, so...

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:07.520
做得好 斯蒂芬 太棒了
Well done, Stefan. That's great. That's great.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.720
你和我爸说的话一样
You sound like my dad.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.640
哦

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:19.960
抱歉
Sorry.

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.600
他有时会让我觉得很烦
He gets on my nerves sometimes.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.400
比如这个 我现在已经没事了
Like this... I'm fine now,

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.240
我不懂为什么还要来参加这些治疗
I don't see why I need to keep coming to these sessions.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.360
我不知道 好像有种受到监控的感觉
It just feels like being... I don't know, monitored.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:44.440
也许是因为周年快到了 所以你有受到侵扰的感觉
Perhaps you're feeling intruded upon because of the anniversary looming.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:50.160
每年这时间你都不好受 这点不能小看
It's a difficult time of year for you. We can't underestimate that.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.440
你想谈谈你母亲的遭遇吗？
Would you like to talk about what happened with your mother?

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:03.520
回顾往事可能会有帮助 哪怕你觉得之前已经这样做过
It can be helpful to revisit things. Even if you feel you've done this before.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.440
你可能会有新的发现
You might discover something new.

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.480
我一直想起那天早上
I keep thinking about that morning.

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.520
再次经历那天的事
Reliving it.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.120
兔子
Rabbit.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.480
是因为兔子
It was because of Rabbit.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.640
就是我妈在我出生时 给我做的那个傻玩具
He was this stupid toy that my mum had made for me when I was born.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.320
我曾经和它寸步不离
I used to take him everywhere.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.600
爸爸可能觉得这样有点女气
I think Dad thought it was sissy or something.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.080
那又怎样 兔子只是个玩具

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.720
他和妈妈经常因为这个大吵
He and Mum used to have these rows about it.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.360
他都五岁了 不该玩娃娃了
By five, he should've stopped playing with dolls.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.720
我知道他拿走了兔子 藏了起来
I know he took rabbit away and hid it somewhere.

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:47.080
那天早上 妈妈去看望外公外婆
That morning, Mum was going to visit Granddad and Grandma.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.920
本来我也要去 但我找不到兔子了
I was supposed to be going with her, but I couldn't find Rabbit anywhere.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.960
没有兔子 我拒绝出门
And I refused to go without him.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.800
快 斯蒂芬 我们要迟到了
Come on, Stefan, we're going to be late.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.400
你来还是不来？
Are you coming or not?

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.440
不去
No!

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.480
快走吧 现在得赶8点45的车了
Come on. You'll have to catch the 8:45, now.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.040
我拖延了她的时间
So I held her up.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.240
因为我 她只能坐晚一点的火车 都是因为我
Because of me she had to catch a later train. Because of me.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.840
斯蒂芬 你当时几岁？
Stefan, how old were you when this happened?

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:28.840
五岁
Five.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.760
你当时才五岁
You were five years old.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.680
你也不可能预见会发生什么
And you couldn't have known.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.840
斯蒂芬
Stefan.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.760
你不可能预见会发生什么
You couldn't have known.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:44.680
急救部门称 8点45分的高速列车脱轨
The Emergency Services say the 8:45 train derailed

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.480
就在皇后镇路车站外面
at high speed outside Queenstown Road Station.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.080
死亡人数继续攀升
As the death toll continues to rise, transport police have opened an inquiry,

With that in mind,

was to prove the final straw.

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.840
他痴迷于诡异的符号
He became obsessed with bizarre symbols

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:03.800
以及他自身自由意志之限制
and the limitations of his own free will.

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:07.560
戴维斯在笔记里重复勾勒一个符号
In his notes, Davies repeatedly sketched a glyph

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:12.840
他认为代表着多重命运 可能的现实一分为二
which to him represented multiple fates, potential realities splitting in two.

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:17.720
这是他精神完全崩溃的开始
It was the start of his complete mental collapse.

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:21.240
戴维斯深信自己对命运毫无控制
Davies became convinced he had no control over his fate

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:24.640
因为妻子在狮形恶魔帕克斯的指使下
because his wife was spiking him with psychoactive drugs

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:29.680
给他服用大量的精神刺激药
at behest of a demon called Pax, a sort of lion figure

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.200
他声称自己见过这个恶魔
who he claimed he'd seen in a vision,

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.840
最后也把恶魔写进了书里
and who ended up being incorporated into the book.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.240
他就是因为这个才杀了妻子
It was this that led him to kill her.

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:41.280
砍下她的头
He decapitated her and daubed the glyph symbol on the walls with her blood.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.840
用她的血在墙上画满了那个符号

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
他被逮捕后 对警察说
After his arrest, he told police

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:53.040
我们同时存在于多重平行现实里
we exist within multiple parallel realities at once.

00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:57.960
每一种现实对应着 我们在人生中可能采取的行动
One reality for each possible course of action we might take in life.

无论我们在这个现实里作何选择
Whatever we choose to do in this existence,

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.080
在另一个现实里 我们都作出了相反的选择 thereâ€™s another one out there in which weâ€™re doing quite the opposite,

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.080
这也使得“自由意志”毫无意义
which renders free will meaningless. Nothing but an illusion.

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.000
一切只不过是幻觉

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:13.560
如果依照这个思路思考下来
If you follow that line of thinking to its logical conclusion...

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:16.080

那么你的任何行为都是无罪的
then you're absolved of any guilt from your actions.

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:24.640
斯蒂芬
Stefan!

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:26.520
科林
Colin.

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:29.520
嗨
Hi.

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:33.200
潘达斯奈基进展如何？
How's Bandersnatch going?

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:35.320
不太好
Not good.

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:38.880
不太好 我有点迷失
Not good. I'm just... lost.

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:43.040
-你在洞里  -什么？
-You're in the hole.  -In the what?

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:46.640
-和自己的大脑作斗争  -对 完全没错
-In a fight with your own head.  -Yes. That's exactly it.

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:51.920
-你待会有什么安排吗？  -没有
-You got anywhere to be later?  -Er, well, no.

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:54.440
跟我来
Come with me.

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.120
斯蒂芬 这位是基蒂
Stefan, this is Kitty.

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:33.480
这位是珀尔
And this is Pearl.

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.280
我的小小女儿
Daddy's little legacy.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.920
斯蒂芬在洞里 基蒂
Stefan's in the hole, Kit.

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:44.200
可怜
Poor thing.

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:47.320
你要帮他出来吗？
Are you going to get him out?

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.040
坐吧
Grab a pew.

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:34.800
给
Here.

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:39.360
-我没抽过…  -来吧
-Oh. I haven't ever really-- -Come on.

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.000
你会习惯的
You'll get the hang of that.

00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.360
一个给你
One for you...

00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:18.320
一个给我
One for me.

00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:23.200
-什么东西？  -能让你看到大局
-What is it?  -It lets you see the bigger picture.

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:28.400
-我不懂  -能帮你理解
-I-I don't know.  -It'll help you understand.

00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:30.760
想要吗？
Do you want it?

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.000
你来抉择
It's your choice.

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:38.560
完全看你的 不要有压力
Totally up to you. Don't feel pressured.

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:48.400
想
Yes.

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.440
这样做
Do this.

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:18.680
现在呢？
Now what?

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.600
现在等着就好
Now we just wait a bit.

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:19.360
人们以为只有一种现实
People think there's one reality

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:21.720
但其实有许多种 像根系一样交织
but there's loads of them, all snaking off, like roots.

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:24.440
我们在一条路线上的行为 会影响到其他路线
And what we do on one path affects what happens on the other paths.

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:26.520
时间是一种构造
Time is a construct.

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:28.760
大家以为无法回到过去 改变事情
People think you can't go back and change things,

00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:30.920
但其实可以 记忆闪回就是这种情况
but you can, that's what flashbacks are,

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:33.880
它们就是邀请人回到过去 做出不一样的抉择
they're invitations to go back and make different choices.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.960
你在做决定时 以为是自己做出的决定 并非如此
When you make a decision, you think it's you doing it, but it's not.

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.800
而是那些与我们世界相连接的灵魂
It's the spirit out there that's connected to our world

00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:41.600
决定着我们要做什么
that decides what we do

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:44.240
我们只要随波逐流就好
and we just have to go along for the ride.

00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:47.240
镜子让人穿行时间
Mirrors let you move through time.

00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:48.960
政府监控着大家
The government monitors people,

00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:51.560
花钱雇人假装你的亲戚
they pay people to pretend to be your relatives

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:54.760
在你食物里下药 拍摄你
and they put drugs in your food and they film you.

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:57.040
每个游戏里都有讯息
There's messages in every game.

00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:59.760
比如吃豆人 你知道游戏名PAC代表什么吗？
Like Pac-Man. Do you know what PAC stands for?

00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:03.000
PAC即“规划与控制”
"Program and Control."

00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:06.920
吃豆人其实就是规划与控制者 整个游戏都是一种隐喻
He's Program and Control Man, the whole thing's a metaphor,

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:10.040
他以为自己有自由意志 但其实是困在迷宫里
he thinks he's got free will but really he's trapped in a maze,

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:12.360
困在体系里 只能吃吃吃
in a system, all he can do is consume,

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:14.600
追逐他的恶魔 大概是他假想出来的
he's pursued by demons that are probably just in his own head,

00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:17.680
就算他从迷宫一侧逃离出来了
and even if he does manage to escape by slipping out one side of the maze,

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:18.640
又会发生什么？
what happens? He comes right back in the other side.

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.680
他马上又从另一侧回到了迷宫里

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:22.000
大家以为这是个开心的游戏
People think it's a happy game,

00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:25.000
但并非如此 那是个噩梦世界
it's not a happy game, it's a fucking nightmare world

00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:27.520
最糟糕的是 那世界是真实的 我们都活在其中
and the worst thing is it's real and we live in it.

00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:29.240
全是代码
It is all code.

00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:31.560
仔细听的话 能听到数字
If you listen closely, you can hear the numbers.

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:37.960
宇宙有一张流程图 决定了你可以去哪 不可以去哪
There's a cosmic flowchart that dictates where you can and where you can't go.

00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:42.160
我已经给了你这份知识 让你自由了
I've given you the knowledge. I've set you free.

00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:45.560
你明白吗？
Do you understand?

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:48.840
也许吧
Maybe.

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:51.960
嗯 算是吧
Yes. Sort of.

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:56.040
我让你看看我是什么意思 跟我来
I'll show you what I mean. Come with me.

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:06.600
我们在一条路线上
We're on one path.

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:08.680
现在的我和你
Right now, me and you.

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:12.160
一条路线如何终结并不重要
And how one path ends is immaterial.

00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:18.080
重要的是我们在这条路线上的决定 对整体造成的影响
It's how our decisions along that path affect the whole that matters.

00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:20.160
你相信我吗？
Do you believe me?

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:23.520
不知道
I don't know.

00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:25.280
我证明给你看
I'll prove it.

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:29.520
我们中的一个人过去
One of us is going over.

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:31.840
过去那边
Over there.

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:37.320
你会死的
You'd die. You'd die.

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:42.200
不重要 因为还有其他时间线 斯蒂芬
It wouldn't matter because there are other timelines, Stefan.

00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:45.560
你看到吃豆人死过多少次了？
How many times have you watched Pac-Man die?

00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:47.360
对他没什么影响
Doesn't bother him.

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:49.920
他重新来过就好
He just tries again.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.960
我们俩之间的一个人要跳 是谁？
One of us is jumping, so who's it going to be?

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.840
上面凉风习习
It's a nice breeze up here.

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:09.080
来吧 我们俩谁跳？
So, come on, which one of us is jumping?

00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:16.080
我来
I'll do it.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:17.840
我喜欢你的风格
I like your style.

00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:44.520
（四个月后）

00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:48.320
（全新干净石板）

00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:58.000
（潘达斯奈基）

00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:01.920
潘达斯奈基（塔克软件 6.95英镑）

00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:06.480
罗宾 《潘达斯奈基》有何优点吗？
So, Robin, Bandersnatch, any good?

00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:09.200
难说 因为你也知道
This is hard to say, because as you may know,

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:12.040
游戏原作者在悲剧事件中死亡
the original author of this game was killed in a tragic accident.

00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:14.960
-是啊  -但游戏就是不怎么好
-Indeed. -But it's just not a good game.

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:19.240
好像是其他人赶制出来的 非常突兀 不和谐
It seems someone else finished it off quickly but it's just abrupt and jarring.

00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:23.320
多余 可怕 暴力 不安 诡异
And unnecessary, and horrible, and violent, unsettling, and weird,

00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:27.720
糟糕 骇人 黑暗 阴郁 惊悚…
and awful, and scary, and dark, and bleak and creepy...

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:35.840
我觉得 把心里的顾虑说出来
The healthiest thing to do is to talk about any concerns you may have

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:37.960
比憋在心里 要更健康
instead of bottling them up inside.

00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:40.440
你得和她谈谈
You need to speak to her.

00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:44.840
我觉得 把心里的顾虑说出来
The healthiest thing to do is to talk about any concerns you may have

00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:47.120
比憋在心里 要更健康
instead of bottling them up inside.

00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:49.720
你得和她谈谈
You need to speak to her.

00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:54.400
我觉得 把心里的顾虑说出来
The healthiest thing to do is to talk about any concerns you may have

00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:56.400
比憋在心里 要更健康
instead of bottling them up inside.

00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:59.000
你得和她谈谈
You need to speak to her.

00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:02.720
你看到吃豆人死过多少次了？
How many times have you watched Pac-Man die?

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:04.440
对他没什么影响
Doesn't bother him.

00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:07.080
他重新来过就好
He just tries again.

00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:11.800
我们俩之间的一个人要跳 是谁？
One of us is jumping, so who's it going to be?

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:19.000
上面凉风习习
It's a nice breeze up here.

00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:26.240
来吧 我们俩谁跳？
So, come on, which one of us is jumping?

00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:32.320
你跳
You do it.

00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:35.160
好
Fair enough.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.240
再见
See you around.

00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:53.880
科林在哪？
Where's Colin?

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:09.840
到了
We're here.

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:16.800
-科林跳了下去 我没阻止他  -斯蒂芬
-Colin jumped and I didn't stop him.  -Stefan...

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:20.280
你的状况可能不太好
maybe you're not well.

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:22.880
去和海恩斯医生谈谈
Go and speak to Dr. Haynes.

00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:25.240
求你了
Please.

00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:28.960
好
Alright.

00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:31.760
什么样的事情？
What sort of things?

00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:33.960
早餐吃什么 听什么音乐
What I have for breakfast. What music I listen to.

00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:35.640
咬不咬指甲
Whether I bite my fucking nails.

00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:38.200
-你感觉自己不是…  -作出这些决定的人
-You feel you're not...  -Making these decisions, no,

00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:40.280
我们之前谈过这个 我很肯定
and we've talked about this before. I'm sure we have.

00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:43.160
你说我对妈妈的死感到内疚 提高了我的药量
And you tell me I feel guilty about my mum and you up my dose.

00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:45.520
我确实有在吃药 好吧？
And, yes, I am taking my medication, OK?

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:48.280
快点给我开他妈的处方
So just write me the fucking prescription.

00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:58.640
（鼻子跳水）

00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:03.960
复制不够快 人人都想要科林·里特曼的游戏
We can't dupe them fast enough. Everybody wants a bit of Colin Ritman.

00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:05.800
-科林呢？  -逃班了
-Where is Colin?  -He's gone AWOL.

00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:07.960
大概去阿姆斯特丹找园艺地点了
Probably fucked off to Amsterdam for a spot of gardening,

00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:09.720
你懂我意思吧 他会回来的 总是如此
if you know what I mean. He'll be back, he always is.

00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:10.760
（后退  杀死特工）

00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:12.880
哥们 今天交工
Mate. This is due today.

00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:15.040
给我这周末就好 我一定能加上这条新路线
I just need the weekend. I know I can add this new path.

00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:18.400
别搞砸了 这项目现在十分紧要
Don't fuck up. There's a lot riding on this now.

00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:19.440
我知道
I know.

00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:26.520
科林让我给你这个 找灵感
Er... Colin wanted me to give you this. To inspire you.

戴维斯深信自己对命运毫无控制
Davies became convinced he had no control over his fate.

00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:34.720
如果依照这个思路思考下来
If you follow that line of thinking to its logical conclusion,

00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:37.480
那么你的任何行为都是无罪的
then you're absolved of any guilt from your actions.

00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:39.560
那些行为甚至并非是你自己的
But they're not even your actions.

00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:41.520
在你控制之外
It's out of your control.

00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:43.840
你的命运被人主宰
Your fate has been dictated.

00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:46.000
所以 杀人有什么不可以？
So, why not commit murder?

00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:48.960
控制命运的人不是你
You're not in control.

Who's there? Who are you?

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:20.360
给我个讯号好不好
Just give me a sign.

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.280
拜托 真有人的话 给我个讯号
Oh, come on. If there's someone there, just give me a sign.

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:25.720
给我个讯号行不行？
Will you give me a sign?

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:29.720
我知道有人 他妈的给我个讯号！
I know there's someone there. Just give me a fucking sign!

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:44.360
斯蒂芬？
Stefan?

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:49.120
-你在做什么？  -我不知道
-What are you doing?  -I don't know.

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:51.920
斯蒂芬 你让我很担心
Stefan, you're worrying me.

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:57.880
-我无力控制  -你在说什么？斯蒂芬？
-I'm not in control. I'm not in control.  -What are you talking about? Stefan?

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:05.640
-有人控制我  -斯蒂芬？停下
-I'm being controlled.  -Stefan! Stefan? Stop it. OK?

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:11.720
冷静下来 深呼吸 冷静
Look, you need to calm down. Just take a breath, please and calm down.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.640
用鼻子呼吸
In through your nose. Breathe. Breathe in through the nose and out.

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:16.200
用鼻子吸气和呼气

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:19.080
吸气 斯蒂芬 呼气
Breathe in, Stefan. And out.

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:20.040
冷静
Calm, Stefan.

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:21.640
离我远点 拜托 爸
Get away from me! Please, Dad.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.640
离我远点 我无力控制
Dad, just stay away from me. I'm not in control.

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:27.720
-斯蒂芬 拜托  -爸 请离我远点
-Stefan, please.  -Dad, please get away from me.

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.040
我无力控制 求你了
I'm not in control. Please, I'm not in control.

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:33.920
-斯蒂芬  -我无力控制
-Stefan.  -I'm not in control.

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:55.000
怎么办？
What do I do?

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.080
怎么办？
What do I do?

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:30.040
好
OK.

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:41.600
-喂？  -是奇才本人啊
-Hello?  -The man himself, the whiz kid.

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:43.000
情况怎么样？
How's it going?

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.080
情况怎么样？
-How's it going?  -Listen.

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:49.120
听着 科林依然在探索其他维度空间
Colin's still off exploring other dimensions.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.760
我靠不住他 所以必须拿到代码 你说过 周一一早给我
He can't bail me out so I need the code. First thing Monday you said.

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:55.200
广告已经放了 工厂也预定了
The ads are out, I've booked the dupe plants.

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:59.120
你交不出货 很多钱就打水漂了
There's some serious cash down the swanny if you don't deliver.

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:02.480
今天之前我必须拿到 这样可能吗？
I need it by the end of today. That possible?

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:04.560
斯蒂芬？
Stefan?

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.120
喂？说话
Hello? Spit it out.

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:08.800
不然我要升级动作了
Before I evolve.

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:15.320
今天结束前能做好吗？
Will it be ready by the end of the day?

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:19.360
-当然  -很好
-Of course. -Good.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:22.400
今天结束前 不能再晚了 再见
By the end of today, no later. Tatty bye.

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:25.800
科林在哪？他人呢？
Where's Colin? Where is he?

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:26.960
他人呢？
-Where... where is he?  -Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Can I help?

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:30.720
-怎么了？  -是科林女朋友 基蒂 我们见过面
-It's Colin's girlfriend.  -Kitty. We've met before.

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:33.880
当时你头发是蓝色 萨特帕尔 我来处理
When you had blue hair. Satpal, I'll deal with this.

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:36.080
-科林在哪？  -我以为你知道呢
-Where's Colin?  -I thought you'd tell me.

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:37.520
他不见了
He's gone, he's just gone.

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:39.920
我知道 但他之前也这样做过
Tell me about it but he's done this before.

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.800
这次不一样 你上次见到他是什么时候？
Not like this. When did you see him last?

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.720
就是他把录像带给我 让我拿给斯蒂芬的时候
When he gave me that tape for Stefan.

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:47.440
斯蒂芬是谁？
Who's Stefan?

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:49.240
别牵扯斯蒂芬进来 他在工作
Let's leave Stefan out of this, he's working.

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:51.200
斯蒂芬是谁？
Who is Stefan?

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:41.520
你是斯蒂芬吗？
Are you Stefan?

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:46.040
对 我们见过面
Yes. We... we've met before.

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:47.480
并没有
No, we haven't.

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:49.160
你知道科林在哪吗？
Do you know where Colin is?

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:51.280
Er...

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:56.040
我去了办公室 萨特帕尔说你最后见到他
I was in the office and Satpal said you'd seen him last.

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:01.360
如果知道他在哪 请告诉我
If you know where he is, please tell me.

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:09.200
抱歉 我不知道
No, I'm sorry. I don't... I don't know.

01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:11.880
我什么都不知道
I don't know anything about anything.

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.240
好吧
Right.

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.440
如果有科林的消息
Well, if you hear from Colin, tell him to ring Kitty.

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:20.920
-叫他打电话给基蒂  -好 我还有事
OK. I've got to go.

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:53.880
（运行）

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:25.800
（微游戏）

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:28.000
因此 未来主义者相信
And that's why futurologists believe

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:31.000
将来能够随时随地玩游戏
you'll be able to play the games of the future anywhere.

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:35.800
公车上 地铁里 手掌之中
On a bus, or the tube, in the palm of your hand.

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:39.080
-克里斯宾？  -谢谢 莱斯莉
-Crispin? -Thanks, Leslie.

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:43.760
昨日 在数周的争议和猜测之后
Now yesterday, following weeks of controversy and speculation,

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:48.480
塔克软件游戏公司宣布进入清算
games company Tuckersoft announced it's going into liquidation.

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:50.040
哪里出问题了呢？
So what went wrong?

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:53.880
仅仅六个月前 塔克软件还势头汹汹
Just six months ago, Tuckersoft was riding high,

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:56.320
一系列热门产品占据榜首
with a string of hits topping the charts

01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:00.360
大家对其圣诞大作《潘达斯奈基》的 期待也不断走高
and mounting anticipation for their big Christmas release, Bandersnatch.

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:03.040
但《潘达斯奈基》流产了
But Bandersnatch never appeared,

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:06.680
因为游戏创作者 19岁的斯蒂芬·巴特勒被逮捕
following the arrest and subsequent murder charge against its creator,

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:09.080
并面临谋杀指控
19-year-old Stefan Butler,

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:11.280
指控罪名是在心理崩溃后
who stands accused of murdering his father,

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.400
谋杀了亲生父亲
following a psychological breakdown.

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:15.120
这使大家质疑
This has raised questions about the judgement of Tuckersoft boss,

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:18.880
塔克软件老板莫汗·塔克尔的判断力
Mohan Thakur.

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:22.200
是他想一个人做 是他的决定
It was his idea to do it alone. His decision.

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:24.240
我也不知道他干不来
I wasn't to know he couldn't hack it.

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:30.120
我知道他父亲死了 愿他安息 但我也是受害者
I mean, I know his dad's dead, rest his soul, but I'm a victim too.

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:31.960
不要忘记这一点
Let's try to not forget that.

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:36.320
但塔克软件还有一位门生 处于神秘中心
But there's another Tuckersoft protÃ©gÃ© at the centre of a mystery.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:39.560
著名程序师科林·里特曼 依然下落不明
Famed programmer Colin Ritman is still missing,

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:43.320
他在谋杀事件不久前 突然消失得无影无踪
having vanished without trace shortly before the killings.

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:46.200
巴特勒在庭审时
At the trial, Butler denied any involvement

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:48.600
否认与里特曼的突然失踪有关
in Ritman's sudden disappearance,

01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:53.120
他声称 在幻觉里看到了里特曼自杀
claiming he had seen Ritman committing suicide in a vision.

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:56.320
今天 塔克公司永远关上了大门
Today, Tuckersoft closed its doors for good.

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:59.400
《潘达斯奈基》无处可寻
And there was no sign of Bandersnatch.

01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:18.440
怎么办？
What do I do?

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:30.000
怎么办？
What do I do?

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:39.520
你看到吃豆人死了多少次？
How many times have you watched Pac-Man die?

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:42.120
对他没影响 他重新来过就好
Doesn't bother him. He just tries again.

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:44.560
科林·里特曼
Colin Ritman.

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:48.560
-我们之前见过  -没有
-We've met before.  -No.

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:52.480
我们见过 我说过会再见的 我说对了
We met before. I told you I'd see you around. And I was right.

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:53.920
我们要迟到了
We're going to be late. Are you coming or not?

01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:57.760
-你来还是不来？  -不去 8点45分的火车脱轨…
-No! -The 8:45 derailed...

01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:59.320
滚开 我无力控制
Fuck off! I'm not in control.

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:02.360
-我们一起面对  -今天交工
-We're in it together.  -The deadline is today.

01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:04.640
-给我周末就好  -也许有些灵感
-I just need the weekend. -Bit of inspiration maybe.

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:05.600
（杰罗姆片子）

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:06.640
你不过是个木偶
You're just a puppet.

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:08.280
所以 杀人有什么不可以？
So, why not commit murder?

01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:11.320
他妈的给我个讯号！
Just give me a fucking sign!

01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:12.280
斯蒂芬？
Stefan?

01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:28.520
怎么办？
What do I do?

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:46.400
真要这样吗？
Oh, God, really?

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:52.480
海恩斯医生办公室
Dr. Haynes' office.

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:55.360
海恩斯医生在吗？
-Is Dr. Haynes there?  -No. She's with a client right now.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.120
不在 她正在见客户

01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:59.200
你想预约时间吗？
Would you like to make an appointment? I could fit you in...

01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:02.440
我可以安排你明天第一个见她
first thing tomorrow.

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:04.280
好
Yes.

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:08.040
-你的名字是？  -斯蒂芬·巴特勒
-And your name is?  -Stefan Butler.

01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:11.400
他妈的占线
He's fucking engaged.

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:14.280
大概是他没有把电话挂好
He's probably taken the phone off the hook.

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:18.400
-我就会这样做  -你这样做？
-That's what I do.  -That's what you do, is it?

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:19.880
我会记住的
I'll remember that.

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:24.920
随他去吧
Look, just let him be.

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:27.600
他大概在专心赶工
-He's probably in the zone.  -OK. I'll give him another 24 hours.

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:28.880
好

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.880
我再给他24小时

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:44.440
（运行）

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.320
你父亲怎么样？
And how is your father?

01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:56.560
他去法国南部见妹妹了
He's visiting his sister. She's in the South of France, so...

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:59.000
那你现在可以随心所欲了
So you've been left to your own devices.

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:11.760
其实挺好的
It's been good actually.

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:14.040
他不在身边
Not having him.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.400
现在我可以真正带着意义感而工作
It's meant I could work with a real sense of purpose.

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.200
游戏上也真正有了突破
I've actually had a bit of breakthrough with the game.

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:30.440
之前陷入了困境 但现在我能看清了
I think I'd got bogged down before but now I can see.

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.240
你终于做完了？
So you finally finished it?

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:36.160
做完了 交付了 全完事了
Finished, delivered, everything.

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:38.920
我之前一直想给玩家太多选择
I'd been trying to give the player too much choice.

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:41.920
所以我回头去除了许多选择
So I just went back and stripped loads out.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:48.160
现在他们以为有自由意志 但其实结局是我来决定的
And now they've got the illusion of free will, but really... I decide the ending.

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:52.560
是个幸福结局吗？
And is it a happy ending?

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:55.200
我想是的
I think so.

01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:56.920
那就好
Then that's great.

01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:24.720
《潘达斯奈基》推荐与否？
So Bandersnatch? Yes or no?

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:27.880
完全推荐 游戏面面俱到
Yes, yes, and yes. It's got all the bases covered.

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:29.120
简直完美
The perfect game.

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:31.560
这还是头一回 所以你的评定是…
Well, that is a first. So your rating is...

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:35.600
我给满分 五颗星 非常杰出
My rating is five stars out of five. Magnificent.

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:39.080
这是1984年电视节目 对《潘达斯奈基》的评判
That was the game Bandersnatch being reviewed on TV back in 1984.

游戏作者斯蒂芬·巴特勒 被发现谋杀生父

游戏撤下货架 所有副本被毁
The game was pulled from shelves and all the copies were pulped.

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:51.600
现在 一位程序员想为新一代人 重启这个游戏
Now, in a move that's bound to cause controversy,

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:54.600
此举必定会引发争议

（汤姆森双胞胎乐团《入沟》 《这才叫音乐·二》）

01:31:57.320 --> 01:31:59.320
（朋友 没有未来）

01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:12.880
（塔克软件）
Hello, Tuckersoft.

01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:17.040
漂亮 干得好 萨特帕尔
Oh, beautiful. Nice one, Satpal.

01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:22.760
去买本森香烟 还有巧克力棒 好孩子
Alright, fetch us 20 B&amp;H, would you? And Lion bar. Good boy.

01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:27.360
你就是斯蒂文
Ah. You... are... Steven.

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:28.800
-是斯蒂芬  -斯蒂芬 抱歉
-Stefan.  -Stefan, sorry, mate.

01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:30.000
没事 大家总是会叫错
That's alright, I get it all the time.

01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:32.800
抱歉有点乱 我们周一刚搬来
Sorry about the chaos. We just moved in Monday.

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.160
地方很大
It's big.

01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:36.640
扩张 就是我的计划
Well, expansion, that's my plan.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:40.280
想想 一整个团队 只做图像
Imagine, OK, a whole team just for graphics,

01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:42.680
这边团队做声音 那边做情节
another for sound, for gameplay.

01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:47.000
我们会成为热门产品工厂 就像电脑游戏界的摩城唱片
We're going to be a hit factory. Like Motown but for computer games.

01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:49.240
这话 你是第一个听到的人
You heard it here first.

01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:51.320
（金属头）

01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:54.120
这是科林的新作
That's Colin's new one.

01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:58.240
-科林·里特曼？  -他就在那
-Colin Ritman?  -That's him over there.

01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:02.600
太疯狂了 他的游戏我都玩过
That's crazy. I've played all of his games.

01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:03.600
去打个招呼吧
Let's say hello.

01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:06.360
-他在工作 确定他不介意吗？  -没事的
-Sure he won't mind, he's working?  -He'll be fine. He'll be fine. Shh! Shh!

01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:10.320
等等
Wait, wait, wait.

01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:13.960
听什么呢 卡加咕咕乐团？
What's this, Kajagoogoo?

01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:17.600
怎么可能
You wish.

01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:20.840
看看他这状态 今年赚的钱都够买兰博基尼了
State of him, he's made enough this year to buy a Lamborghini

01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:22.720
但还是抽自己卷的烟
and he still smokes roll-ups.

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:26.440
外面卖的卷烟都有士的宁 闹笑话的人是他
Yeah, well, pre-rolled have strychnine in them, so the joke's on him.

01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:29.600
随便了 这位是斯蒂芬…
Anyway, this is Stefan, er...

01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:31.560
巴特勒
Butler, Butler.

01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:35.920
我是科林
I'm Colin, yeah.

01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:39.240
嗯 我玩过你所有游戏 全部所有
Yeah, I've played all of your games. All of them.

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:42.920
除了康懋达电脑上的那些 我没有康懋达电脑
Except the Commodore ones, I don't have a Commodore.

01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:47.880
-康懋达电脑声卡不错  -是啊
Great sound chip, the Commodore. Yeah.

01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:50.800
这是我最新的游戏
This is my latest.

01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:51.920
（运行）

01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:57.480
叫鼻子跳水
It's called Nohzdyve.

01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:06.640
-游戏界面真流畅  -花了一些功夫
-The sprites are so smooth.  -That took some doing.

01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:11.040
可恶
Oh, bollocks.

01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:13.880
-怎么了？  -缓冲区错误
-What's that?  -It's a buffer error.

01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:16.520
显存超了
The eyeballs have overrun the video memory, and--

01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:19.880
是啊 显存 我正要说呢
Oh, yeah, yeah, video memory, yeah. I was gonna say that.

01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:21.880
这样 说正经事吧
Anyway, listen, let's get down to business.

01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:24.320
斯蒂芬要给我们演示点东西
Stefan's got something to demo for us.

01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:26.680
厉害了
Bloody hell.

01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:30.720
就像三维怪物迷宫？
So it's like 3D Monster Maze?

01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:32.640
不过人是在不断进行选择
Only when you're moving from choice to choice.

01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:35.840
-其实是一个探险游戏  -像《霍比特人》
-It's actually an adventure game.  -Like The Hobbit.

01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:38.920
嗯 但不用打字
Yes, but without any typing.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:42.720
不用打字？ 所以不会有“找灯”什么的？
Without any typing? So no "get lamp" or whatever?

01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:44.200
对
That's right.

01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:54.920
屏幕上出现选择 倒计时内确定就行
Choices come up on the screen and you pick one against the clock.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.200
（弱小的人类 要崇拜我吗？）

01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:59.160
他是恶魔帕克斯 是书里的
OK, he's Pax, he's the demon. He's in the book.

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:01.040
我们其实到了一个选择点
So we've actually arrived at a choice point,

01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:02.960
用游戏杆进行选择
and then you can choose with the joystick.

01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:04.560
有十秒时间
You've got ten seconds.

01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:06.200
崇拜他
Worship him.

01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:08.360
不要这样 他是命运的窃贼
No, don't do that, he's the Thief of Destiny, in the book, I mean.

01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:09.920
我是说 在书里

01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:13.720
我家里有一本 但从没读过
Got a copy of this at home. Never got around to reading it.

01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:16.440
你应该读读 杰罗姆·戴维斯是天才
You should. Jerome F. Davies was a genius.

01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:19.160
他不是发疯了 砍下了妻子的头吗？
Didn't he go bonkers and cut his wife's head off?

01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:21.440
-是 但我是说除了这点之外…  -不好意思
-Yeah, but I mean, apart from that-- -Excuse me.

01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:23.920
（崇拜帕克斯）

01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:25.480
（超出范围）

01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:26.880
怎么回事？
What's happened?

01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:29.240
这条路的程序我还没写
Well, I haven't programmed that pathway yet.

01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:30.160
有很多条路？
Lot of paths then?

01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:34.760
嗯 如果按书里来 就会这样
Well, yeah, if it's going to be like the book.

01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:37.760
那你打算怎么办？
So, come on. How do you want to go about this?

01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:42.160
-你感兴趣？  -当然啊
-You're... you're interested?  -That's what I'm saying.

01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:44.880
现在是七月 如果要冲击圣诞节
OK, it's July now, so if we want to hit Christmas,

01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:46.960
那我们在十一月就要投入生产
then we'll need the tapes in Smiths by November.

01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:51.400
我的提议是 你来这里写程序
OK. So here's my proposal. Come and write it here.

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:53.720
-这里？  -对啊
-Here?  -Yeah!

01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:57.480
我们专门为你安排几张桌子 建一个小团队
We'll give you a couple of desks, set up a small team, just for you.

01:35:57.840 --> 01:35:59.640
当然 科林也在附近
And of course Col's on hand.

01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:01.360
你怎么想？
What do you reckon?

01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:04.920
对了 我下周会雇用一个做声卡的
Oh, and hey, I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.800
所以音乐我们可以解决 全在公司内部做
so music we can take care of. All in-house.

01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:10.200
说吧 你怎么看？
So, come on. What's your answer?

01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:18.400
（1984年7月9日）

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:24.400
吃早餐吗？
Breakfast?

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:26.120
潘达什么？
-Your Bander-what?  -Bandersnatch.

01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:29.520
潘达斯奈基 这本书是“选择自己的冒险”
-It's a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book.  -That bloody hound from next door!

01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:30.520
隔壁那条该死的猎犬 真是烦死人了
Be the death of us.

01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:36.360
（朋友  没有未来）

01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:40.080
（塔克软件）

01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:42.000
我们会成为热门产品工厂
We're going to be a hit factory.

01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:45.280
科林·里特曼？太疯狂了 我玩过他所有游戏
Colin Ritman? That's crazy. I've played all of his games.

01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:48.240
看看他这状态 今年赚的钱都够买兰博基尼了
State of him, he's made enough this year to buy a Lamborghini

01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:50.440
但还是抽自己卷的烟
and he still smokes roll-ups.

01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:58.520
-我们之前见过  -没有
-We've met before.  -No.

01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:02.840
我现在在做这个
This is what I'm working on.

01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:07.880
-鼻子跳水  -没错
-Nohzdyve.  -Yeah. That's right.

01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:09.000
（运行）

01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:15.120
可恶
Oh, bollocks.

01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:16.880
-怎么了？  -缓冲区错误
-What's that?  -Buffer error.

01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:22.000
游戏界面超显存了
Those eyeball sprites overshot the video memory.

01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:24.560
你怎么知道
How did you know that?

01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:28.280
-没怎么啊  -我的天 他很优秀吧？
-Just did.  -Bloody hell, he's good, right?

01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:33.320
好了 来说正经事 斯蒂芬有东西要演示给我们看
Anyway, let's get down to business. Stefan's got something to demo for us.

01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:37.720
用游戏杆做选择 有十秒时间
You choose with the joystick. See. You've got ten seconds.

01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:40.840
别崇拜他 他是命运之窃贼
Don't worship him, he's the Thief of Destiny.

01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:43.720
-你读过《潘达斯奈基》？  -杰罗姆·戴维斯 很有远见
-You've read Bandersnatch?  -Jerome F. Davies. Visionary.

01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:46.840
他就是那个发了疯 把老婆脑袋砍掉的家伙？
Was he that bloke who went cuckoo and cut his wife's head off?

01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:48.520
对 大家都倾向于关注这一点
That is what people tend to focus on, yes.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.280
你是哪个结局？读那本书的时候
Which ending did you get? When you read it.

01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:52.720
-全部结局  -不好意思
-All of them.  -Excuse me.

01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:56.160
（崇拜帕克斯）

01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:59.920
-怎么回事？  -这条路的程序我还没写
-What's happened?  -I haven't programmed that path yet.

01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:02.280
是哦 有很多条路？
Right. So, a lot of paths then?

01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:05.000
对 如果按书里来 就会这样
Well, yes, if it's going to be like the book.

01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:06.680
书里有很多不同的现实
A lot of divergent realities in that book.

01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:10.840
这本书很超前 因为时间是存在的
It was ahead of its time. In as much as time exists.

01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:16.080
好 我的提议是 你来这里写程序
OK. So here's my proposal. Come and write it here.

01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:18.000
这里？
Here?

01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:20.640
我们专门为你安排几张桌子 建一个小团队
We'll give you a couple of desks, set up a small team, just for you.

01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:22.120
当然 科林也在附近
And of course Col's on hand.

01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:24.240
你怎么想？
What do you reckon?

01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:27.400
对了 我下周会雇用一个做声卡的
Oh, and hey, I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:29.840
所以音乐我们可以解决 全都内部来做
so music we can take care of. All in-house.

01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:32.760
说吧 你怎么看？
So, come on. What's your answer?

01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:36.480
不
No.

01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:48.760
我的意思是 我确实想做你的游戏 但是…
I mean, yes, I want to do your game. I just... I just think I need to...

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:56.240
我需要按自己想法来写
I need to write it how I know.

01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:59.720
就我一个人 在家里写
You know, just me. At home.

01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:02.280
在家里 你一个人？
At home. On your own?

01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:04.960
对 现在它全在我脑子里
Yeah, it's just that it's all in my head,

01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:06.320
如果让其他人插手
and I think if I let other people in, it'll just get, I don't know, stressy?

01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:09.200
可能会有点压力？

01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:11.360
“有点压力”？
"Stressy"?

01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:17.760
但我知道自己肯定能做好 对得起这本书
But I know that I can do it proper justice. The book.

01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:21.640
各种不同的故事线 平行现实
You know, divergent story paths. Parallel realities.

01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:24.400
-但它也只是个游戏吧？  -我明白
-It's still a game though, yeah?  -I get it.

01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:26.520
这小子是个匠人
The lad's a craftsman.

01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:29.280
孤独的林中居民 我也是
He's a lone woodsman. I'm the same.

01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:31.280
-可是…  -如我所说
-Yeah, but...  -It's like I say,

01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:33.920
团队适合做动作游戏
teams are fine for things like action titles,

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.800
但涉及到玩概念的游戏
but when it's a concept piece,

01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:40.600
就需要一点点疯狂 最好是一个人来想
bit of madness is what you need and that works best when it's one mind.

01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:43.480
好了 蒂莫西·利里 我们晚点再议论《知觉之门》
Alright, Timothy Leary, we'll debate The Doors of Perception later--

01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:46.240
-那是赫胥黎的书 不是利里  -如果你要自己写
That was Huxley, not Leary. If you're going to write this on your tod,

01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:48.560
那重要的是 圣诞需要有成品
the important thing is putting it out for Christmas,

01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:51.040
所以9月12日前要编码完毕
so I'll need finished code by 12th September.

01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:53.000
-好 可以  -不能晚
-OK, sure.  -But no later.

01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:02.960
你都听些什么？
What do you listen to?

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.480
以便让自己进入心流
To get in to the flow.

01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:09.720
音乐啊？
Oh, music?

01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:15.120
主要是合辑
Er, compilations mainly.

01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:17.960
拿支笔
Get a pen.

01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:24.800
我在解冻肉馅
I'm defrosting mince.

01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:31.600
这东西真是黑科技
It's like alien technology this thing.

01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:35.840
情况顺利吗？
Oh. How... how did it go?

01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:39.880
挺好的 很顺利
Good. Yeah, really good.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.080
他们收了
They're taking it.

01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:44.680
-太棒了  -是啊
Oh, well, that's great, isn't it?

01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:49.280
-很厉害  -你手上有肉汁
-Well done, mate.  -You've got mince juice on your hands.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.240
嗯
Yes.

01:40:55.080 --> 01:41:00.040
那是怎样安排？ 你去他们办公室还是？
So, how does it work then? Do you go into their office, or...?

01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:01.480
不去 我在这里写
No, I write it here.

01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:05.560
-自己一个人？  -嗯
-On your own?  -Yes.

01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:10.680
这个…
And...

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:14.640
这种工作这样做好吗？
Is that the best way to work on something like this?

01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:16.240
为什么不好？
Why wouldn't it be?

01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:18.600
画面做得确实很厉害 罗宾
Well, the graphics are certainly impressive, Robin,

01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:21.760
但一个大问题是 玩起来怎么样？
but the big question is, what's it like to play?

01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:25.160
游戏玩法也一样很厉害
Well, the gameplay is just as impressive, I must say.

01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:27.680
这是科林·里特曼的游戏 所以大家期待不低
This is a Colin Ritman game, so we'd expect little else,

01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:31.560
但哪怕以他的标准来看 这游戏也确实非常好
but even by his standards this is really most impressive.

01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:34.400
游戏很有挑战 需要不断学习
It's challenging, there's quite a big learning curve,

01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:38.600
玩家会死很多次 必须多次尝试 但我并不怎么介意
so you die a lot and have to try again but I really didn't mind that much.

01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:41.680
听起来很棒 罗宾 你的评定是？
So it sounds great but what's your verdict, Robin?

01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:44.400
满分五星 我给四星 科林·里特曼再次成功了
Four stars out of five. Colin Ritman does it again.

01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:47.480
-所以还不够完美  -没有什么是完美无缺的
-So not quite perfect. -Well, nothing's perfect.

01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:54.480
我在那里 那边是科林·里特曼…
So there I am, there's Colin Ritman--

01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:57.960
“真正的科林·里特曼” 我记得你是这样说的
"The actual Colin Ritman," I believe you called him.

01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:03.680
没错 而且塔克尔先生给我机会
Yeah, exactly, and Mr. Thakur's offering me the chance to work there

01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:06.760
可以去他们办公室 在科林身边工作
in their own office alongside Colin.

01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:09.800
而我…
And I just...

01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:14.600
-不知道 有点太过…  -太过？
-I don't know. It was too...  -Too?

01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:16.440
太过理想 不像是真的
Good to be true.

01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:21.360
-我拒绝了  -你拒绝了？
-I said no.  -You said "no"?

01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:23.240
不是拒绝一整件事
Well, not to the whole thing,

01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:26.160
只是拒绝去那里工作 在其控制之下
just to working there and being under their control.

01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:27.640
不知道为什么
I don't know where it came from,

01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:29.920
我就说了“不” 然后必须给自己找理由
I just said "no" and then had to justify it

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.360
说自己喜欢独自工作
by saying that I prefer to work alone.

01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:36.960
我只是不知道哪来的那股冲动
But I just don't know where the urge to say it came from.

01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:41.400
你听起来越来越自信了 这是好迹象
It sounds like you're growing in confidence. I think it's a good sign.

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:45.360
他们还是让我做游戏 所以…
Well, they're still letting me do the game, so...

01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:49.680
做得好 斯蒂芬 太棒了
Well done, Stefan. That's great.

01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:53.080
你和我爸说的话一样
You sound like my dad.

01:42:58.040 --> 01:42:59.000
哦

01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:02.320
抱歉
Sorry.

01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:05.960
他有时会让我觉得很烦
He gets on my nerves sometimes.

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:09.760
比如这个 我现在已经没事了
Like this... I'm fine now,

01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:14.560
我不懂为什么还要来参加这些治疗
I don't see why I need to keep coming to these sessions.

01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:20.720
我不知道 好像有种受到监控的感觉
It just feels like being, I don't know, monitored.

01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:26.760
也许是因为周年快到了 所以你有受到侵扰的感觉
Perhaps you're feeling intruded upon because of the anniversary looming.

01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:32.520
每年这段时间你都不好受 这点不能小看
It's a difficult time of year for you. We can't underestimate that.

01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:37.800
你想谈谈你母亲的遭遇吗？
Would you like to talk about what happened with your mother?

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:45.880
回顾往事可能会有帮助 哪怕你觉得之前已经这样做过
It can be helpful to revisit things. Even if you feel you've done this before.

01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:50.760
你可能会有新的发现
You might discover something new.

01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:22.880
政府在你食物里下药 拍摄你
The government put drugs in your food and they film you.

01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:44.760
（三周后）

01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:07.960
（9月12日）

01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:10.920
（项目交付日）

01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:15.160
（鼻子跳水）

01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:22.040
复制不够快 人人都想要科林·里特曼的游戏
We can't dupe them fast enough. Everybody wants a bit of Colin Ritman.

01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:26.200
-科林呢？  -鬼知道 逃班了
-Where is Colin?  -God knows. He's gone AWOL.

01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:27.680
人没来 电话也不接
He hasn't come in, answered his phone. Par for the course from him.

01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:29.360
他这样也不是一次两次了

01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:31.440
大概去阿姆斯特丹找园艺地点了
Probably fucked off to Amsterdam for a spot of gardening.

01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:34.040
他会回来的 总是如此
He'll be back, he always is. Anyway, come on.

01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:47.800
看着不错 好在我把广告加倍了
Looking good. Good thing I doubled on the advertising.

01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:51.280
（特工对你产生了怀疑）

01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:52.560
（后退  杀死特工）

01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:55.960
这不是…
That's not...

01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:58.760
斯蒂芬 今天交工 你之前说很稳定的
Stefan, mate. This is due today. You said it was stable.

01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:00.840
-之前是的 只是…  -只是什么？
-It was, I just-- -Just what?

01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:02.440
我新加了一条路线
I added in a new path,

01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:05.200
政府阴谋分支 我以为这样就没有漏洞了
the government conspiracy branch, I thought I'd tied up all the loose ends.

01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:06.600
这是你新加的 拿掉不就好了
If it's something you've added, let's just take it out.

01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:08.920
-不行 它很重要  -斯蒂芬
-No, it's important.  -Stefan, mate.

01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:11.040
交付日是今天
The deadline is today.

01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:14.120
给我这个周末就行 我一定能把新路线加进去
I just need the weekend. I know I can squeeze this path in.

01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:17.360
-游戏已经足够复杂了  -就这个周末 拜托了
-It's complicated enough.  -Just the weekend. Please.

01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:22.720
-周一一早给我  -一定
-First thing Monday.  -First thing.

01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:27.160
我得赶快走了 要见约翰孟席斯公司的人
OK. Shit, I've got to run, meeting the John Menzies guys.

01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:30.840
千万别搞砸了 这项目现在十分紧要
Just don't fuck up. There's a lot riding on this now.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:32.000
我知道
I know.

01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:40.760
科林让我给你这个
Er... Colin wanted me to give you this.

01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:42.240
（杰罗姆片子）

01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:43.240
这是什么？
What is it?

01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:46.160
他说是从电视上录下来的 给你些灵感
He said he taped it off the telly, to inspire you.

01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:51.800
-你知道科林在哪吗？  -不知道 抱歉
-Do you know where Colin is?  -No. Sorry.

01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:07.840
（《看门 拿钥匙》）

01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:10.040
（杰罗姆片子 《杰罗姆·戴维斯之各色人生》）

01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:20.320
你今晚看电影？
You having a film night?

01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:28.080
（杰罗姆片子）

01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:34.200
-棒极了  -家乐氏香甜玉米片
-They're great! -Kellogg's Frosties.

01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:36.000
（播放）

01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:39.280
（心灵之眼 杰罗姆·戴维斯）

01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:40.760
在人生末期
Towards the end of his life,

01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:45.520
戴维斯每日自行服用致幻剂
Davies was apparently self-administering hallucinogens on a daily basis.

01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:47.480
再加上他努力想要完成
This, coupled with his attempts

01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:50.680
《潘达斯奈基》的复杂多重叙事
to complete the complex multiple narratives of Bandersnatch

01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:53.000
成为了压垮他的最后一根稻草
was to prove the final straw.

01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:55.520
他痴迷于诡异的符号
He became obsessed with bizarre symbols

01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:58.640
以及他自身自由意志之限制
and the limitations of his own free will.

01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:02.360
戴维斯在笔记里重复勾勒一个符号
In his notes, Davies repeatedly sketched a glyph

01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:07.640
他认为代表着多重命运 可能的现实一分为二
which to him represented multiple fates, potential realities splitting in two.

01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:12.520
这是他精神完全崩溃的开始
It was the start of his complete mental collapse.

01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:16.040
戴维斯深信自己对命运毫无控制
Davies became convinced he had no control over his fate

01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:19.440
因为妻子在狮形恶魔帕克斯的指使下
because his wife was spiking him with psychoactive drugs

01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:24.640
给他服用大量的精神刺激药
at the behest of a demon called Pax, a sort of lion figure,

01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:26.000
他声称自己见过这个恶魔
he claimed he'd seen in a vision,

01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:28.640
最后也把恶魔写进了书里
and who ended up being incorporated into the book.

01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:34.040
他就是因为这个才杀了妻子
It was this that led him to kill her.

01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:36.120
砍下她的头
He decapitated her and daubed the glyph symbol on the walls with her blood.

01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:39.240
用她的血在墙上画满了那个符号

01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:43.640
他被逮捕后 对警察说
After his arrest, he told police

01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:48.000
我们同时存在于多重平行现实里
we exist within multiple parallel realities at once.

01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:52.680
每一种现实对应着 我们在人生中可能采取的行动
One reality for each possible course of action we might take in life.

01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:55.520
无论我们在这个现实里作何选择
Whatever we choose to do in this existence,

01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:58.840
在另一个现实里 我们都作出了相反的选择 thereâ€™s another one out there in which weâ€™re doing quite the opposite,

01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:01.880
这也使得“自由意志”毫无意义
which renders free will meaningless. Nothing but an illusion.

01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:03.600
一切只不过是幻觉

01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:33.040
镜子让人穿行时间
Mirrors let you move through time.

01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:31.240
那又怎样 兔子只是个玩具
Yes, and so what, Rabbit is a toy.

01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:33.080
他去哪都带着这个小孩子玩具
A baby's toy that he takes everywhere.

01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:34.000
他五岁了
He's five.

01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:35.840
五岁的孩子不该玩娃娃了
By five he should've stopped playing with dolls.

01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:38.360
-那不是娃娃  -要是他带着它去见你爸妈
-It's not a doll.  -If he takes it to your parents,

01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:40.840
你爸爸又要教训我
I'm going to have to withstand another lecture from your dad

01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:43.000
-说我育儿太宽松了  -我的天
-about permissive child-rearing.  -Oh, for God's sake.

01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:45.680
抱歉 但我得解决这个问题
No, I'm sorry, look, I am going to do something about this.

01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:21.640
（潘达斯奈基）

01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:31.520
（函数未定义）

01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:21.440
够娱乐了吗 心理变态？
How's that for entertainment, you psychiatric fuck? Huh?

01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:24.520
让你一天都很不爽吧 是不是？
Fucked your day up good and proper, didn't we?

01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:27.320
嗯？我和来自未来的朋友！
Me and my friend from the future!

01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:38.400
（《看门 拿钥匙》）

01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:02.160
好
Yes.

01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:04.240
完美
Perfect. Perfect.

01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:07.360
好 第一件事就是稍微精简一下项目
OK, so the first thing we need to do is streamline the project a little.

01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:10.600
做一整本书 体量太大
We can't fit a breeze block of a book into 48K.

01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:15.840
抱歉 哥们 选错路了
Sorry, mate. Wrong path.

01:53:24.040 --> 01:53:26.480
对了 我下周会雇用一个做声卡的
Oh, and hey, I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:28.760
所以音乐我们可以解决 全在公司内部做
so music we can take care of. All in-house.

01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:29.960
你怎么看？
What do you reckon?

01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:34.000
对了 我下周会雇用一个做声卡的
Oh, and hey, I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:36.320
所以音乐我们可以解决 全在公司内部做
so music we can take care of. All in-house.

01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:37.600
你怎么看？
What do you reckon?

01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:41.640

So, come on. How do you want to go about this?

01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:58.560
-你感兴趣？  -当然啊
-You're... you're interested?  -That's what I'm saying.

那我们在十一月就要投入生产

And of course Col's on hand.

说吧 你怎么看？
So, come on. What's your answer?

01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:31.840
-不  -需要一点点疯狂
-No.  -A bit of madness is what you need.

01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:37.160
你想谈谈你母亲吗？
Would you like to talk about your mother?

Stefan, I'm worried about you. You've been stuck in your room for weeks.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:58.160
斯蒂芬？
Stefan?

01:54:58.960 --> 01:54:59.960
你能和我谈谈吗？
Will you talk to me?

Look, I can't help you if you just sit there and don't speak!

01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:12.200

01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:18.200
吃早餐吗？
Breakfast?

01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:19.920
潘达什么？
-Your Bander-what?  -Bandersnatch.

01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:23.280
潘达斯奈基 这本书是“选择自己的冒险”
-It's a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book.  -That bloody hound from next door!

01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:24.400
隔壁那条该死的猎犬 真是烦死人了
Be the death of us.

01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:30.160
（朋友 没有未来）

01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:33.880
（塔克软件）

01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:35.800
我们会成为热门产品工厂
We're going to be a hit factory.

01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:39.080
科林·里特曼？太疯狂了 我玩过他所有游戏
Colin Ritman? That's crazy. I've played all of his games.

01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:42.080
看看他这状态 今年赚的钱都够买兰博基尼了
State of him, he's made enough this year to buy a Lamborghini

01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:44.160
但还是抽自己卷的烟
and he still smokes roll-ups.

01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:52.120

We've met before.

-This is what I'm working on.  -Nohzdyve.

-可恶  -怎么了？
-Oh, bollocks.  -What's that?

01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:13.360
缓冲区错误 游戏界面超显存了
Buffer error. The eyeball sprites overshot the video memory.

01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:14.760
对
Yep.

（弱小的人类 要崇拜我吗？）

-You've read Bandersnatch?  -Jerome F. Davies. Visionary.

他就是那个发了疯 把老婆脑袋砍掉的家伙？
Was he that bloke who went cuckoo and cut his wife's head off?

01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:26.240
对 大家都倾向于关注这一点
That is what people tend to focus on, yes.

01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:27.840
不好意思
Excuse me.

01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:30.480

-怎么回事？  -这条路的程序我还没写
-What's happened?  -I haven't programmed that path yet.

01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:36.480
书里有很多不同的现实
A lot of divergent realities in that book.

01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:40.640
这本书很超前 因为时间是存在的
It was ahead of its time. In as much as time exists.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:45.880
好 我的提议是 你来这里写程序
OK. So here's my proposal. Come and write it here.

-这里？  -我们专门为你安排几张桌子

说吧 你怎么看？
So, come on. What's your answer?

-不  -需要一点点疯狂
-No.  -Bit of madness is what you need.

Would you like to talk about your mother?

一切都还好吗？
Is everything alright?

Look, I can't help if you just sit there and don't speak!

Dad, just fuck off!

01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:25.840
拿上外套 我们出去吃午饭
Get your coat. We're going for lunch.

01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:33.160
-这是海恩斯医生的地方  -你得和她谈谈
-This is Dr. Haynes' place.  -You need to speak to her.

01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:38.080
你压力太大了 你不吃东西 不睡觉
You're under pressure. You're not sleeping, you're not eating.

01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:44.600
我觉得 把心里的顾虑说出来
I think the healthiest thing to do is to talk about any concerns you may have

01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:46.920
比憋在心里 要更健康
instead of bottling them up inside.

01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:54.800
我们之前谈过这个 我很肯定
We've talked about this before. I'm sure we have.

01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:56.160
快点给我开他妈的处方
So just write me the fucking prescription.

我这周末就好 我一定能加上这条新路线
I just need the weekend. I know I can add this new path in.

01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:04.520
别搞砸了 这项目现在十分紧要
Don't fuck up. There's a lot riding on this now.

01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:05.880
（杰罗姆片子）

01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:09.720
我们同时存在于多重平行现实里
We exist within multiple parallel realities at once.

01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:14.320
每一种现实对应着 我们在人生中可能采取的行动
One reality for each possible course of action we might take in life.

01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:17.160
无论我们在这个现实里作何选择
Whatever we choose to do in this existence,

01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:20.280
在另一个现实里 我们都作出了相反的选择 thereâ€™s another one out there in which weâ€™re doing quite the opposite,

01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:22.720
这也使得“自由意志”毫无意义
which renders free will meaningless. Nothing but an illusion.

01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:24.120
一切只不过是幻觉

01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:27.840
-这是海恩斯医生的地方  -你得和她谈谈
-This is Dr. Haynes' place.  -You need to speak to her.

我脑子里一团乱 我无力控制
My head is all over the place. I'm not in control.

给我个讯号好不好
Just give me a sign.

02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:25.480
拜托 真有人的话 给我个讯号好不好
Come on. If there's someone there, just give me a sign.

Will you give me a sign?

《潘达斯奈基》推荐与否？
So Bandersnatch? Yay or nay?

02:05:19.680 --> 02:05:21.640
游戏内容完全没有
Well, nothing in the game is as fascinating

02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:23.880
其背后可怕的现实故事那样精彩
as its grisly real-life backstory.

你知道 莱斯莉 游戏作者斯蒂芬·巴特勒
As you know, Leslie, Stefan Butler, the young man who wrote this,

02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:28.720
精神崩溃 杀死了生父
had a breakdown and murdered his own father.

02:05:28.800 --> 02:05:30.200
对 非常可惜
Yes, very sad.

02:05:30.280 --> 02:05:32.640
似乎代码没有写完
And it seems the code was never quite finished

02:05:32.720 --> 02:05:34.480
但塔克公司仍然发布了游戏
but Tuckersoft just released the game anyway.

02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:36.560
虽然这样做不如谋杀那样罪恶
Which I know isn't a crime on a par with murder

02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:38.440
但依然不光彩
but it's still pretty off nonetheless.

02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:40.160
相当不光彩 所以你的评定是？
Quite. So your verdict?

满分五星 我给二星半
Two and a half stars out of five.

02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:45.480
最多只能满足人的病态好奇 要更加努力才行
It's morbid curiosity value at best. Must try harder.

我一直想起那天早上
I keep thinking about that morning.

再次经历那天的事
Reliving it.

02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:02.600
兔子 是因为兔子
Rabbit. It was because of Rabbit.

02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:05.760
就是我妈在我出生时 给我做的那个傻玩具
He was this stupid toy that my mum had made him when I was born,

02:06:06.880 --> 02:06:08.480
我曾经和它寸步不离
I used to take him everywhere.

02:06:09.080 --> 02:06:11.880
爸爸可能觉得这样有点女气
I think Dad thought it was sissy or something.

02:06:12.280 --> 02:06:14.120
那又怎样 兔子只是个玩具

02:06:14.200 --> 02:06:16.840
他和妈妈经常因为这个大吵
He and Mum used to have these rows about it.

02:06:16.920 --> 02:06:19.320
他都五岁了 不该玩娃娃了
And by five he should've stopped playing with dolls.

02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:22.880
我知道他拿走了兔子 藏了起来
I know he took Rabbit away and hid it somewhere.

02:06:25.160 --> 02:06:29.200
那天早上 妈妈去看望外公外婆
That morning, Mum was going to visit Granddad and Grandma.

02:06:29.480 --> 02:06:33.040
本来我也要去 但我找不到兔子了
I was supposed to be going with her, but I couldn't find Rabbit anywhere.

02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:35.080
没有兔子 我拒绝出门
I refused to go without him.

02:06:35.160 --> 02:06:36.920
快 斯蒂芬 我们要迟到了
Come on, Stefan, we're going to be late.

02:06:37.600 --> 02:06:39.560
你来还是不来？
Are you coming or not?

02:06:50.440 --> 02:06:51.600
不去
No!

02:06:51.960 --> 02:06:54.640
快走吧 现在得赶8点45的车了
Come on. You'll have to catch the 8:45, now.

02:06:56.720 --> 02:06:58.160
我拖延了她的时间
So I held her up.

02:06:58.800 --> 02:07:02.360
因为我 她只能坐晚一点的火车 都是因为我
Because of me she had to catch a later train. Because of me.

02:07:03.960 --> 02:07:06.960
斯蒂芬 你当时几岁？
Stefan, how old were you when this happened?

02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:10.960
五岁
Five.

02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:13.880
你当时才五岁
You were five years old.

02:07:14.080 --> 02:07:15.840
你也不可能预见会发生什么
And you couldn't have known.

02:07:16.920 --> 02:07:18.000
斯蒂芬
Stefan.

02:07:19.040 --> 02:07:20.920
你不可能预见会发生什么
You couldn't have known.

02:07:21.480 --> 02:07:23.480
急救部门称
The Emergency Services say

02:07:23.560 --> 02:07:29.600
8点45分的高速列车脱轨 就在皇后镇路车站外面
the 8:45 train derailed at high speed outside Queenstown Road Station.

02:07:31.760 --> 02:07:34.240
死亡人数继续攀升
As the death toll continues to rise, transport police have opened an inquiry

02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:39.160
交警已开始调查 但起因尚不清楚
but the cause is not yet clear.

02:07:42.160 --> 02:07:44.040
我为这件事恨死他了
I fucking hate him for it.

02:07:45.920 --> 02:07:48.040
往事无法改变 斯蒂芬
The past is immutable, Stefan.

02:07:49.800 --> 02:07:53.080
无论多痛苦 我们都改变不了事情
No matter how painful it is, we can't change things,

02:07:53.160 --> 02:07:56.000
事后回想 我们也无法做出不同选择
we can't choose differently, with hindsight.

02:07:56.920 --> 02:07:59.080
我们都得学会接受现实
And we all have to learn to accept that.

02:08:04.240 --> 02:08:07.560
记住 需要我就给我打电话
Remember. Any time you need me, just pick up the phone.

02:08:08.240 --> 02:08:09.440
你知道号码
You know the number.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:23.000
斯蒂芬？
Stefan?

02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:24.280
（运行）

02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:26.160
一切都还好吗？
Is everything alright?

02:08:26.960 --> 02:08:27.960
（潘达斯奈基）

02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:36.320
斯蒂芬？
Stefan?

02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:38.240
你能和我谈谈吗？
Will you talk to me?

02:08:40.880 --> 02:08:42.640
（函数未定义）

02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:45.000
你坐着一言不发 我也帮不了你
Look, I can't help you if you just sit there and don't speak!

02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:49.000
我一直想起那天早上
I keep thinking about that morning.

02:08:51.920 --> 02:08:52.960
再次经历那天的事
Reliving it.

02:08:54.760 --> 02:08:56.960
兔子 是因为兔子
Rabbit. It was because of Rabbit.

02:08:57.400 --> 02:09:00.120
就是我妈在我出生时 给我做的那个傻玩具
He was this stupid toy that my mum had made for me when I was born.

02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:02.800
我曾经和它寸步不离
I used to take him everywhere.

02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:06.080
爸爸可能觉得这样有点女气
I think Dad thought it was sissy or something.

02:09:06.160 --> 02:09:08.480
那又怎样 兔子只是个玩具

02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:11.200
他和妈妈经常因为这个大吵
He and Mum used to have these rows about it.

02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:13.680
他都五岁了 不该玩娃娃了
And by five he should've stopped playing with dolls.

02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:17.280
我知道他拿走了兔子 藏了起来
I know he took Rabbit away and hit it somewhere.

02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:23.520

02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:29.880
-你能和我谈谈吗？  -爸 滚出去
-Will you talk to me?  -Dad, just fuck off!

02:11:31.760 --> 02:11:34.440
拿上外套 我们出去吃午饭
Get your coat. We're going for lunch.

02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:37.520
不
No.

02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:40.240
这样做又有什么好处？
What good does it do?

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.160
不断回忆往事
Going over things again and again.

02:11:44.080 --> 02:11:45.440
仔细想想
Think carefully.

02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:48.480
你可能真的会有新发现
You really might learn something new.

02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:51.360
我再问一次
So I'll ask again.

02:11:52.440 --> 02:11:55.400
你想谈谈母亲的遭遇吗？
Would you like to talk about what happened with your mother?

02:12:02.440 --> 02:12:05.600
你可能会更了解自己 说不定的

I fucking hate him for it.

往事无法改变 斯蒂芬
The past is immutable, Stefan.

02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:02.720
无论多痛苦 我们都改变不了事情
No matter how painful it is, we can't change things,

02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:05.680
事后回想 我们也无法做出不同选择
we can't choose differently, with hindsight.

02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:08.720
我们都得学会接受现实
And we all have to learn to accept that.

Remember. Any time you need me, just pick up the phone.

Dad, just fuck off!

-This is Dr. Haynes' place.  -You need to speak to her.

You're under pressure. You're not sleeping, you're not eating.

在人生末期
Towards the end of his life,

02:20:41.560 --> 02:20:46.240
戴维斯每日自行服用致幻剂
Davies was apparently self-administering hallucinogens on a daily basis.

02:20:46.320 --> 02:20:48.200
再加上他努力想要完成
This, coupled with his attempts

《潘达斯奈基》的复杂多重叙事
to complete the complex multiple narratives of Bandersnatch

02:20:51.640 --> 02:20:53.720
成为了压垮他的最后一根稻草

02:20:54.320 --> 02:20:56.360
他痴迷于诡异的符号
He became obsessed with bizarre symbols

以及他自身自由意志之限制
and the limitations of his own free will.

02:20:59.600 --> 02:21:03.080
戴维斯在笔记里重复勾勒一个符号
In his notes, Davies repeatedly sketched a glyph

02:21:03.160 --> 02:21:08.360
他认为代表着多重命运 可能的现实一分为二
which to him represented multiple fates, potential realities splitting in two.

02:21:09.360 --> 02:21:13.240
这是他精神完全崩溃的开始
It was the start of his complete mental collapse.

02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:16.760
戴维斯深信自己对命运毫无控制
Davies became convinced he had no control over his fate

02:21:16.840 --> 02:21:20.160
因为妻子在狮形恶魔帕克斯的指使下
because his wife was spiking him with psychoactive drugs

02:21:20.600 --> 02:21:25.200
给他服用大量的精神刺激药
at the behest of a demon called Pax, a sort of lion figure,

02:21:25.440 --> 02:21:26.720
他声称自己见过这个恶魔
he claimed he'd seen in a vision,

最后也把恶魔写进了书里

It was this that led him to kill her.

砍下她的头
He decapitated her and daubed the glyph symbol on the walls with her blood.

用她的血在墙上画满了那个符号

他被逮捕后 对警察说
After his arrest, he told police

02:21:44.600 --> 02:21:48.720
我们同时存在于多重平行现实里
we exist within multiple parallel realities at once.

02:21:49.160 --> 02:21:53.400
每一种现实对应着 我们在人生中可能采取的行动
One reality for each possible course of action we might take in life.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.240
无论我们在这个现实里作何选择
Whatever we choose to do in this existence,

02:21:56.320 --> 02:21:59.680
在另一个现实里 我们都作出了相反的选择 thereâ€™s another one out there in which weâ€™re doing quite the opposite,

02:21:59.760 --> 02:22:02.640
这也使得“自由意志”毫无意义
which renders free will meaningless. Nothing but an illusion.

02:22:02.720 --> 02:22:04.520

Shit, I've got to run, meeting the John Menzies guys.

Towards the end of his life,

02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:50.800
戴维斯每日自行服用致幻剂
Davies was apparently self-administering hallucinogens on a daily basis.

02:28:50.880 --> 02:28:52.760
再加上他努力想要完成
This, coupled with his attempts

《潘达斯奈基》的复杂多重叙事
to complete the complex multiple narratives of Bandersnatch

02:28:56.200 --> 02:28:58.280
成为了压垮他的最后一根稻草
was to prove the final straw.

02:28:58.880 --> 02:29:00.920
他痴迷于诡异的符号
He became obsessed with bizarre symbols

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.840
以及他自身自由意志之限制
and the limitations of his own free will.

02:29:04.120 --> 02:29:07.640
戴维斯在笔记里重复勾勒一个符号
In his notes, Davies repeatedly sketched a glyph

02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:12.920
他认为代表着多重命运 可能的现实一分为二
which to him represented multiple fates, potential realities splitting in two.

02:29:13.920 --> 02:29:17.800
这是他精神完全崩溃的开始
It was the start of his complete mental collapse.

02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:21.320
戴维斯深信自己对命运毫无控制
Davies became convinced he had no control over his fate

02:29:21.400 --> 02:29:24.720
因为妻子在狮形恶魔帕克斯的指使下
because his wife was spiking him with psychoactive drugs

02:29:25.160 --> 02:29:29.920
给他服用大量的精神刺激药
at the behest of a demon called Pax, a sort of lion figure,

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:31.280
他声称自己见过这个恶魔
he claimed he'd seen in a vision,

02:29:31.360 --> 02:29:33.920
最后也把恶魔写进了书里
and who ended up being incorporated into the book.

02:29:37.440 --> 02:29:39.320
他就是因为这个才杀了妻子
It was this that led him to kill her.

02:29:40.120 --> 02:29:41.400
砍下她的头
He decapitated her and daubed the glyph symbol on the walls with her blood.

02:29:41.480 --> 02:29:44.520
用她的血在墙上画满了那个符号

02:29:47.080 --> 02:29:49.080
他被逮捕后 对警察说
After his arrest, he told police

02:29:49.160 --> 02:29:53.280
我们同时存在于多重平行现实里
we exist within multiple parallel realities at once.

02:29:53.720 --> 02:29:57.960
每一种现实对应着 我们在人生中可能采取的行动
One reality for each possible course of action we might take in life.

02:29:58.560 --> 02:30:00.800
无论我们在这个现实里作何选择
Whatever we choose to do in this existence,

02:30:00.880 --> 02:30:04.080
在另一个现实里 我们都作出了相反的选择 thereâ€™s another one out there in which weâ€™re doing quite the opposite,

02:30:04.160 --> 02:30:07.160
这也使得“自由意志”毫无意义
which renders free will meaningless. Nothing but an illusion.

02:30:07.240 --> 02:30:09.000
一切只不过是幻觉

-Er, where is Colin?  -God knows. He's gone AWOL.

人没来 电话也不接
He hasn't come in, hasn't answered his phone.

02:31:02.920 --> 02:31:04.080
他这样也不是一次两次了
Par for the course from him.

大概去阿姆斯特丹找园艺地点了

02:37:51.840 --> 02:37:55.000
《潘达斯奈基》的复杂多重叙事
to complete the complex multiple narratives of Bandersnatch

02:37:55.240 --> 02:37:57.280
成为了压垮他的最后一根稻草
was to prove the final straw.

02:37:57.920 --> 02:37:59.920
他痴迷于诡异的符号
He became obsessed with bizarre symbols

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.920
以及他自身自由意志之限制
and the limitations of his own free will.

02:38:03.160 --> 02:38:06.680
戴维斯在笔记里重复勾勒一个符号
In his notes, Davies repeatedly sketched a glyph

02:38:06.760 --> 02:38:11.960
他认为代表着多重命运 可能的现实一分为二
which to him represented multiple fates, potential realities splitting in two.

02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:16.840
这是他精神完全崩溃的开始
It was the start of his complete mental collapse.

02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:20.360
戴维斯深信自己对命运毫无控制
Davies became convinced he had no control over his fate

02:38:20.440 --> 02:38:23.760
因为妻子在狮形恶魔帕克斯的指使下
because his wife was spiking him with psychoactive drugs

02:38:24.200 --> 02:38:28.760
给他服用大量的精神刺激药
at behest of a demon called Pax, a sort of lion figure,

02:38:29.040 --> 02:38:30.320
他声称自己见过这个恶魔
he claimed he'd seen in a vision,

02:38:30.400 --> 02:38:32.920
最后也把恶魔写进了书里
and who ended up being incorporated into the book.

02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:38.360
他就是因为这个才杀了妻子
It was this that led him to kill her.

02:38:39.160 --> 02:38:40.440
砍下她的头
He decapitated her and daubed the glyph symbol on the walls with her blood.

02:38:40.520 --> 02:38:43.600
用她的血在墙上画满了那个符号

02:38:46.120 --> 02:38:48.120
他被逮捕后 对警察说
After his arrest, he told police

02:38:48.200 --> 02:38:52.280
我们同时存在于多重平行现实里
we exist within multiple parallel realities at once.

02:38:52.760 --> 02:38:56.960
每一种现实对应着 我们在人生中可能采取的行动
One reality for each possible course of action we might take in life.

02:38:57.600 --> 02:38:59.840
无论我们在这个现实里作何选择
Whatever we choose to do in this existence,

02:38:59.920 --> 02:39:03.080
在另一个现实里 我们都作出了相反的选择 thereâ€™s another one out there in which weâ€™re doing quite the opposite,

02:39:03.160 --> 02:39:06.240
这也使得“自由意志”毫无意义
which renders free will meaningless. Nothing but an illusion.

02:39:06.320 --> 02:39:08.000
一切只不过是幻觉

02:39:17.760 --> 02:39:21.800

复制不够快 人人都想要科林·里特曼的游戏
We can't dupe them fast enough. Everybody wants a bit of Colin Ritman.

02:40:00.120 --> 02:40:03.240
-科林呢？  -鬼知道 逃班了
-Er, where is Colin?  -God knows. He's gone AWOL.

02:40:03.320 --> 02:40:04.720
人没来 电话也不接
He hasn't come in, hasn't answered his phone.

02:40:05.160 --> 02:40:06.280
他这样也不是一次两次了
Par for the course from him.

02:40:06.360 --> 02:40:08.480
大概去阿姆斯特丹找园艺地点了
He's probably fucked off to Amsterdam for a spot of gardening.

02:40:08.640 --> 02:40:11.080
他会回来的 总是如此
He'll be back, he always is. Anyway, come on.

02:40:21.280 --> 02:40:24.840
看着不错 好在我把广告加倍了
Looking good. Good thing I doubled on the advertising.

Stefan, mate. This is due today. You said it was stable.

02:40:35.840 --> 02:40:37.880
-之前是的 只是…  -只是什么？
-It was, it was. I just-- -Just what?

02:40:38.200 --> 02:40:40.600
我新加了一条路线 政府阴谋分支
I added in a new path, the government conspiracy branch.

02:40:40.680 --> 02:40:42.240
我以为这样就没有漏洞了
Thought I'd tied up the loose ends.

02:40:42.320 --> 02:40:43.600
这是你新加的 拿掉不就好了
If it's something you've added, let's just take it out.

02:40:43.680 --> 02:40:45.960
-不行 它很重要  -斯蒂芬
-No, it's important.  -Stefan, mate.

02:40:46.720 --> 02:40:48.080

The deadline is today.

给我这个周末就行 我一定能把新路线加进去
I just need the weekend. I know I can squeeze this path in.

02:40:51.800 --> 02:40:54.400
-游戏已经足够复杂了  -就这个周末 拜托了
-It's complicated enough.  -Just the weekend. Please.

02:40:58.200 --> 02:40:59.760
-周一一早给我  -一定
-First thing Monday.  -First thing.

02:41:00.160 --> 02:41:01.240
好吧
OK.

02:41:01.320 --> 02:41:03.440

Shit, I've got to run, meeting the John Menzies guys.

02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:07.880

他说是从电视上录下来的 给你些灵感
He said he taped it off the telly, to inspire you.

If you follow that line of thinking to its logical conclusion,

那么你的任何行为都是无罪的
then you're absolved of any guilt from your actions.

那些行为甚至并非是你自己的
They're not even your actions.

在你控制之外
It's out of your control.

03:02:37.720 --> 03:02:39.520
你的命运被人主宰
Your fate has been dictated.

03:02:40.040 --> 03:02:41.600
所以 杀人有什么不可以？
So, why not commit murder?

You're not in control.

你知道游戏名PAC代表什么吗？
You know what PAC stands for?

03:34:24.480 --> 03:34:27.520
PAC即“规划与控制” 吃豆人其实就是规划与控制者

（1984年7月9日）

03:35:08.640 --> 03:35:09.680
吃早餐吗？
Breakfast?

03:35:10.560 --> 03:35:12.120
-潘达什么？  -潘达斯奈基
-Your Bander-what?  -Bandersnatch.

03:35:12.200 --> 03:35:13.320
这本书是“选择自己的冒险”
-It's a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book.  -The bloody hound from next door.

03:35:13.400 --> 03:35:14.800

太疯狂了 他的游戏我都玩过
That's crazy. I've played all of his games.

03:35:29.800 --> 03:35:32.880
看看他这状态 今年赚的钱都够买兰博基尼了
The state of him, he's made enough this year to buy a Lamborghini,

03:35:32.960 --> 03:35:35.040
但还是抽自己卷的烟
and he still smokes roll-ups.

03:35:41.520 --> 03:35:42.720
我们之前见过
We've met before.

03:35:43.840 --> 03:35:45.680
-没有  -我们见过
-No.  -We met before.

03:35:45.760 --> 03:35:47.480
我说过我们会再见的
I told you I'd see you around. And I was right.

03:35:47.880 --> 03:35:48.960
我说对了

03:35:51.680 --> 03:35:53.560
-我现在在做这个  -鼻子跳水
-This is what I'm working on.  -Nohzdyve.

03:35:58.760 --> 03:35:59.800
可恶
Oh, bollocks.

03:35:59.880 --> 03:36:01.040
-怎么了？  -缓冲区错误
-What's that?  -Buffer error.

03:36:01.760 --> 03:36:04.160

03:36:04.720 --> 03:36:05.560
是啊
Yep.

03:36:07.040 --> 03:36:09.360
别崇拜他 他是命运之窃贼
Don't worship him, he's the Thief of Destiny.

03:36:09.440 --> 03:36:12.240
-你读过《潘达斯奈基》？  -杰罗姆·戴维斯 很有远见
-You've read Bandersnatch?  -Jerome F. Davies. Visionary.

03:36:12.640 --> 03:36:14.800
他就是那个发了疯 把老婆脑袋砍掉的家伙？
Was he that bloke who went cuckoo and cut his wife's head off?

03:36:15.440 --> 03:36:17.040
对 大家都倾向于关注这一点
That is what people tend to focus on, yes.

03:36:17.400 --> 03:36:18.680
不好意思
Excuse me.

03:36:20.440 --> 03:36:21.280

03:36:22.360 --> 03:36:25.080
-怎么回事？  -这条路的程序我还没写
-What's happened?  -I haven't programmed that path yet.

03:36:25.720 --> 03:36:27.280
书里有很多不同的现实
Lot of divergent realities in that book.

03:36:27.920 --> 03:36:29.360
这本书很超前
It was ahead of its time.

03:36:29.920 --> 03:36:31.440
因为时间是存在的
In as much as time exists.

03:36:32.800 --> 03:36:35.000
好 我的提议是
OK. So, here's my proposal.

03:36:35.600 --> 03:36:36.680
你来这里写程序
Come and write it here.

03:36:37.960 --> 03:36:39.640

What do you reckon?

03:36:45.840 --> 03:36:48.000
对了 我下周会雇用一个做声卡的
Oh, and hey, I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

03:36:48.080 --> 03:36:50.480
所以音乐我们可以解决 全都内部来做

03:39:48.200 --> 03:39:51.480
现在他们以为有自由意志
And now they've only got the illusion of free will, but really,

03:39:52.080 --> 03:39:53.600

大概是他没有把电话挂好
He's probably taken the phone off the hook.

03:43:26.400 --> 03:43:28.920
-我就会这样做  -你这样做？
-That's what I do.  -That's what you do, is it?

03:43:29.440 --> 03:43:30.400
我会记住的
I'll remember that.

03:43:33.000 --> 03:43:35.440
随他去吧
Look, just let him be.

03:43:36.240 --> 03:43:38.120
他大概在专心赶工
He's probably in the zone.

03:43:38.200 --> 03:43:39.320
好
OK. I'll give him another twenty-four hours.

03:43:39.480 --> 03:43:41.240
我再给他24小时

03:43:54.120 --> 03:43:54.960
（运行）

03:44:01.520 --> 03:44:02.840
你父亲怎么样？
And how is your father?

03:44:04.400 --> 03:44:07.080
他去法国南部见妹妹了
He's visiting his sister. She's in the South of France, so...

03:44:07.400 --> 03:44:09.400
那你现在可以随心所欲了
So you've been left to your own devices.

03:44:21.000 --> 03:44:22.280
其实挺好的
It's been good actually.

03:44:23.400 --> 03:44:24.600
他不在身边
Not having him.

03:44:26.480 --> 03:44:28.960
现在我可以真正带着意义感而工作
It's meant I could work with a real sense of purpose.

03:44:32.720 --> 03:44:34.760
游戏上也真正有了突破
I've actually had a bit of breakthrough with the game.

03:44:35.840 --> 03:44:38.800
之前陷入了困境
I think I'd got bogged down before,

03:44:39.720 --> 03:44:40.960
但现在我能看清了
but now I can see.

03:44:41.200 --> 03:44:42.720
你终于做完了？
-So you finally finished it? -Finished, delivered, everything.

03:44:43.160 --> 03:44:46.560
做完了 交付了 全完事了

03:44:47.080 --> 03:44:49.440
我之前一直想给玩家太多选择
I'd been trying to give the player too much choice.

03:44:49.840 --> 03:44:52.480
所以我回头去除了许多选择
So I just went back and stripped loads out.

03:44:53.240 --> 03:44:56.520
现在他们以为有自由意志
And now they've only got the illusion of free will, but really,

03:44:57.120 --> 03:44:58.640
但其实结局是我来决定的
I decide the ending.

03:45:01.440 --> 03:45:03.080
是个幸福结局吗？
And is it a happy ending?

03:45:04.760 --> 03:45:05.680
我想是的
-I think so.  -Then that's great.

03:45:06.600 --> 03:45:07.440
那就好

03:45:31.160 --> 03:45:32.080
好
OK.

03:45:41.280 --> 03:45:43.800
-喂？  -是奇才本人啊
-Hello?  -The man himself, the whiz kid.

03:45:44.080 --> 03:45:45.200
情况怎么样？
How's it going?

03:45:46.400 --> 03:45:47.480
什么情况怎么样？
"How's it going?"

03:45:48.080 --> 03:45:50.600
难道是我拨错号了？
Have I dialed an echo by mistake?

03:45:50.680 --> 03:45:53.400
醒醒 当然是潘达斯奈基 你答应要做好的游戏
Wakey-wakey. Bandersnatch. The game you promised us.

03:45:53.880 --> 03:45:55.120
你说过 周一一早给我
First thing Monday you said.

03:45:55.520 --> 03:45:57.080
我必须拿到代码
I need the code.

03:45:57.160 --> 03:45:59.360
广告已经放了 工厂也预定了
The ads are out, I've booked the dupe plant.

03:45:59.440 --> 03:46:02.480
你交不出货 很多钱就打水漂了
There's some serious cash down the swanny if you don't deliver.

03:46:03.280 --> 03:46:05.400
今天之前我必须拿到 这样可能吗？
I need it by the end of today. That possible?

03:46:07.640 --> 03:46:10.120
斯蒂芬？喂？
Stefan? Hello?

03:46:10.400 --> 03:46:11.240
说话
Spit it out.

03:46:11.560 --> 03:46:12.920
不然我要升级动作了
Before I evolve.

03:46:17.080 --> 03:46:19.640
今天结束前能做好吗？
Will it be ready by the end of today?

03:46:22.120 --> 03:46:23.680
-当然  -很好
-Of course. -Good.

03:46:24.080 --> 03:46:26.720
今天结束前 不能再晚了 再见
By the end of today, no later. Tatty bye.

03:46:28.520 --> 03:46:31.720
你不该催他的 他需要探索所有可能
You shouldn't rush him. He needs to explore all possibilities.

03:46:32.280 --> 03:46:34.520
他说今天结束前交付
He said he's delivering by the end of today.

03:46:35.000 --> 03:46:35.840
那就没问题了
So, that's good then.

03:46:36.160 --> 03:46:38.440
他说话不靠谱 不然你过去吧
He's bullshitting.

03:46:38.520 --> 03:46:39.880
看看到底怎么回事 帮帮他
Why don't you head round there. See what's really going on. Give him a hand.

03:46:41.080 --> 03:46:43.320
快去 脚别搭在我桌上
Come on. Now get your feet off my table.

03:46:43.640 --> 03:46:46.080
这里可不是无政府主义公社 这是工作场合
This isn't one of your anarchist communes. This is a place of work.

03:46:50.760 --> 03:46:51.640
好
OK.

03:47:00.360 --> 03:47:01.200
嗯 今天结束前
Yeah, end of the day.

03:47:06.520 --> 03:47:09.720
你不该催他的 他需要探索所有可能
You shouldn't rush him. He needs to explore all possibilities.

03:47:10.280 --> 03:47:12.520
他说今天结束前交付
He said he's delivering by the end of today.

03:47:13.120 --> 03:47:15.240
-那就没问题了  -他说话不靠谱
-So, that's good then.  -He's bullshitting.

03:47:15.320 --> 03:47:16.440
不然你过去吧
Why don't you head round there. See what's really going on. Give him a hand.

03:47:16.520 --> 03:47:17.880
看看到底怎么回事 帮帮他

03:47:19.080 --> 03:47:21.320
快去 脚别搭在我桌上
Come on. Now get your feet off my table.

03:47:21.640 --> 03:47:24.080
这里可不是无政府主义公社 这是工作场合
This isn't one of your anarchist communes. This is a place of work.

03:47:28.720 --> 03:47:29.640
好
OK.

03:47:38.360 --> 03:47:39.200
嗯 今天结束前
Yeah, end of the day.

03:47:43.640 --> 03:47:45.200
科林在哪？
Where's Colin? Where is he? Where is he?

03:47:45.280 --> 03:47:46.120
他人呢？

03:47:46.200 --> 03:47:47.280
他人呢？

03:47:48.320 --> 03:47:49.600
-怎么了？  -是科林女朋友
-Woah, woah, woah. Can I help?  -It's Colin's girlfriend.

03:47:49.680 --> 03:47:51.040
基蒂 我们见过面
Kitty. We've met before.

03:47:51.880 --> 03:47:54.200
当时你头发是蓝色 萨特帕尔 我来处理
When you had blue hair. Satpal, I'll deal with this.

03:47:54.800 --> 03:47:56.400
-科林在哪？  -我以为你知道呢
Where's Colin?

03:47:56.480 --> 03:47:57.840
他不见了
-I thought you'd tell me.  -He's gone, he's just gone.

03:47:58.280 --> 03:48:00.240
我知道 但他之前也这样做过
Tell me about it, but he's done this before.

03:48:00.800 --> 03:48:03.120
这次不一样 你上次见到他是什么时候？
Not like this. When did you see him last?

03:48:03.480 --> 03:48:06.080
就是他把录像带给我 让我拿给斯蒂芬的时候
When he gave me that tape for Stefan.

03:48:06.920 --> 03:48:07.760
斯蒂芬是谁？
Who's Stefan?

03:48:07.960 --> 03:48:09.560
别牵扯斯蒂芬进来 他在工作
Let's leave Stefan out of this, he's working.

03:48:10.200 --> 03:48:11.520
斯蒂芬是谁？
Who's Stefan?

03:48:13.040 --> 03:48:13.960
好
OK.

03:48:23.200 --> 03:48:24.360
他妈的挂我电话
Fucker hung up.

03:48:25.520 --> 03:48:27.440
他在努力工作
He's trying to work.

03:48:27.680 --> 03:48:29.120
工作个屁
Oh, work it up your dirt box.

03:48:30.320 --> 03:48:31.400
这样可没什么帮助
That's not constructive.

03:48:31.960 --> 03:48:33.680
没人可以挂我电话
No one hangs up on me.

03:48:40.720 --> 03:48:41.640
好
OK.

03:48:50.800 --> 03:48:52.200
去他妈的！
Fucking fuck!

03:48:52.480 --> 03:48:53.880
科林在哪？
Where's Colin? Where is he? Where is he?

03:48:53.960 --> 03:48:54.920
他人呢？

03:48:55.000 --> 03:48:56.080
他人呢？

03:48:57.040 --> 03:48:58.400
-怎么了？  -是科林女朋友
-Woah, woah, woah. Can I help?  -It's Colin's girlfriend.

03:48:58.480 --> 03:48:59.840
基蒂 我们见过面
Kitty. We've met before.

Where's Colin?

03:49:05.280 --> 03:49:06.640
他不见了

Who's Stefan?

03:49:22.080 --> 03:49:23.960
-不好  -不好？
-No.  -No?

03:49:24.400 --> 03:49:26.120
混账东西
Tough tit-holes.

03:49:26.280 --> 03:49:28.040
你签了合同 别给我犯傻
You signed a contract, so don't be a pillock.

03:49:28.120 --> 03:49:29.280
给我抓紧点
Pull your finger out.

03:49:29.680 --> 03:49:32.600
今天结束前交工 再见！
I expect it by the end of today. Sayonara!

03:49:33.600 --> 03:49:35.120
科林在哪？
Where's Colin? Where is he? Where is he?

03:49:35.200 --> 03:49:36.040
他人呢？

03:49:36.120 --> 03:49:37.200
他人呢？

-怎么了？  -是科林女朋友

Where's Colin?

03:49:46.400 --> 03:49:47.760
他不见了
-I thought you'd tell me.  -He's gone, he's just gone.

03:49:48.200 --> 03:49:50.160

Tell me about it, but he's done this before.

03:49:50.720 --> 03:49:53.040
这次不一样 你上次见到他是什么时候？
Not like this. When did you see him last?

03:49:53.400 --> 03:49:56.000
就是他把录像带给我 让我拿给斯蒂芬的时候
When he gave me that tape for Stefan.

03:49:56.720 --> 03:49:57.680
斯蒂芬是谁？
Who's Stefan?

03:49:57.880 --> 03:49:59.480
别牵扯斯蒂芬进来 他在工作
Let's leave Stefan out of this, he's working.

03:50:00.120 --> 03:50:01.440
斯蒂芬是谁？
Who's Stefan?

03:50:20.680 --> 03:50:22.080
你需要帮手
Well, you need a hand.

03:50:25.880 --> 03:50:27.680
快 带我过去
Come on, lead me to it.

03:50:29.120 --> 03:50:31.920
-去哪？  -潘达斯奈基
-To what?  -Bandersnatch.

03:50:32.560 --> 03:50:34.320
你在哪工作？楼上？
Where's your pit? Up there?

03:50:44.320 --> 03:50:45.840
我的天
Fucking hell.

03:50:46.400 --> 03:50:48.080
你直直掉到洞里了 兄弟
You've gone right down the hole, mate.

03:50:49.080 --> 03:50:50.320
直直掉下去了
Right down it.

03:50:57.520 --> 03:50:58.760
我杀了我爸
I killed my dad.

03:51:00.720 --> 03:51:01.800
好吧
Right.

03:51:05.040 --> 03:51:07.320
那你是要放我走还是杀了我？
So are you gonna let me go, or are you gonna kill me?

03:51:14.200 --> 03:51:15.680
这是你的选择
I mean, it's your choice.

03:51:16.600 --> 03:51:18.520
完全由你来选择
In as much as you have any choice.

03:51:32.000 --> 03:51:34.400
这样大概有点虎头蛇尾
Imagine that's a bit anti-climactic for you.

03:51:36.080 --> 03:51:37.480
不过谢谢你了
But appreciated.

03:51:38.120 --> 03:51:39.840
我很享受这份人生的生活
I'm quite enjoying this lifetime.

03:51:41.000 --> 03:51:42.240
下份人生再见了
See you in the next one.

03:52:09.960 --> 03:52:11.840
（微游戏）

03:52:11.920 --> 03:52:15.040
所以今日的线框模型
So, that's how the wireframe models of today

03:52:15.120 --> 03:52:18.280
可能会成为好莱坞未来的娱乐
might provide the Hollywood entertainment of the future.

03:52:18.520 --> 03:52:19.520
克里斯宾
-Crispin.  -Thanks, Leslie.

03:52:19.600 --> 03:52:20.840
谢谢 莱斯莉

03:52:21.440 --> 03:52:25.280
昨日 在数周的争议和猜测之后
Now, yesterday, following weeks of controversy and speculation,

03:52:25.360 --> 03:52:29.480
塔克软件游戏公司宣布被行政接管
games company Tuckersoft announced it's going into administration.

03:52:29.560 --> 03:52:30.680
哪里出问题了呢？
So, what went wrong?

03:52:31.440 --> 03:52:34.480
仅仅六个月前 塔克软件还势头汹汹
Just six months ago, Tuckersoft was riding high,

03:52:34.560 --> 03:52:36.880
一系列热门产品占据榜首
with a string of hits topping the charts

03:52:36.960 --> 03:52:40.960
大家对其圣诞大作《潘达斯奈基》的 期待也不断走高
and mounting anticipation for their big Christmas release, Bandersnatch.

03:52:41.440 --> 03:52:43.480
但《潘达斯奈基》流产了
But Bandersnatch never appeared,

03:52:43.560 --> 03:52:47.040
因为游戏创作者 19岁的斯蒂芬·巴特勒被逮捕
following the arrest and subsequent murder charge against its creator,

03:52:47.280 --> 03:52:49.640
并面临谋杀指控
19-year-old Stefan Butler,

03:52:49.720 --> 03:52:52.000
指控罪名是在心理崩溃后
who stands accused of murdering his father

03:52:52.080 --> 03:52:54.000
谋杀了亲生父亲
following a psychological breakdown.

03:52:54.080 --> 03:52:56.600
这使大家质疑
This has raised questions about the judgment

03:52:57.480 --> 03:52:59.480
塔克软件老板莫汗·塔克尔的判断力
of Tuckersoft boss, Mohan Thakur.

03:52:59.960 --> 03:53:02.800
是他想一个人做 是他的决定
It was his idea to do it alone. His decision.

03:53:02.960 --> 03:53:04.760
我也不知道他干不来
I wasn't to know he couldn't hack it.

03:53:05.120 --> 03:53:06.880
我知道他父亲死了
I mean, I know his dad's dead, rest his soul,

03:53:07.480 --> 03:53:08.720
愿他安息

03:53:09.000 --> 03:53:10.720
但我也是受害者

这使大家质疑
This has raised questions about the judgment

04:04:07.680 --> 04:04:10.400
塔克软件老板莫汗·塔克尔的判断力
of Tuckersoft boss, Mohan Thakur.

04:04:10.880 --> 04:04:13.720
是他想一个人做 是他的决定
It was his idea to do it alone. His decision.

04:04:13.880 --> 04:04:15.680
我也不知道他干不来
I wasn't to know he couldn't hack it.

04:04:16.040 --> 04:04:17.800
我知道他父亲死了
I mean, I know his dad's dead, rest his soul,

04:04:18.400 --> 04:04:19.640
愿他安息

04:04:19.920 --> 04:04:21.640
但我也是受害者
but I'm a victim, too. Let's try to not forget that.

04:04:21.720 --> 04:04:23.440
不要忘记这一点

04:04:23.520 --> 04:04:27.760
但塔克软件还有一位门生 处于神秘中心
But there's another Tuckersoft protÃ©gÃ© at the center of a mystery.

04:04:27.920 --> 04:04:31.040
著名程序师科林·里特曼 依然下落不明
Famed programmer Colin Ritman is still missing,

04:04:31.120 --> 04:04:34.840
他在谋杀事件不久前 突然消失得无影无踪
having vanished without trace shortly before the killings.

04:04:35.280 --> 04:04:37.760
巴特勒在庭审时
At the trial, Butler denied any involvement

04:04:37.840 --> 04:04:40.080
否认与里特曼的突然失踪有关
in Ritman's sudden disappearance,

04:04:40.160 --> 04:04:44.440
他声称 在幻觉里看到了里特曼自杀
claiming he had seen Ritman committing suicide in a vision.

04:04:44.720 --> 04:04:47.840
今天 塔克公司永远关上了大门
Today, Tuckersoft closed its doors for good.

04:04:47.920 --> 04:04:50.960
《潘达斯奈基》无处可寻
And there was no sign of Bandersnatch.

04:05:45.520 --> 04:05:46.920
你需要帮手
Well, you need a hand.

04:05:50.720 --> 04:05:52.520
快 带我过去
Come on, lead me to it.

04:05:53.960 --> 04:05:56.800
-去哪？  -潘达斯奈基
-To what?  -Bandersnatch.

04:05:57.400 --> 04:05:59.160
你在哪工作？楼上？
Where's your pit? Up there?

04:06:09.120 --> 04:06:10.600
我的天
Fucking hell.

04:06:11.240 --> 04:06:12.920
你直直掉到洞里了 兄弟
You've gone right down the hole, mate.

04:06:13.920 --> 04:06:15.160
直直掉下去了
Right down it.

04:06:22.480 --> 04:06:23.600
我杀了我爸
I killed my dad.

04:06:25.560 --> 04:06:26.680
好吧
Right.

04:06:29.880 --> 04:06:32.160
那你是要放我走还是杀了我？
So are you gonna let me go, or are you gonna kill me?

04:06:39.040 --> 04:06:40.520
这是你的选择
I mean, it's your choice.

04:06:41.440 --> 04:06:43.320
完全由你来选择
In as much as you have any choice.

04:06:47.200 --> 04:06:48.440
对不起
I'm sorry.

04:06:49.320 --> 04:06:52.440
好吧 争论也没意义
Alright. No point arguing about it.

04:06:52.880 --> 04:06:54.520
不过别用那个 刺着疼
Not with that though. They sting.

04:06:56.600 --> 04:06:57.840
有什么钝器吗？
You got anything blunt?

04:07:02.080 --> 04:07:03.600
先把我打晕
Stun me first.

04:07:04.080 --> 04:07:05.640
人性化一点
Bit more humane.

04:07:16.160 --> 04:07:17.040
试试这个
Try this.

04:07:27.120 --> 04:07:28.600
下份人生再见了
See you in the next life, yeah?

04:07:38.760 --> 04:07:40.080
快 砸我的头
Come on, on me head.

04:07:43.480 --> 04:07:45.360
（微游戏）

04:07:46.600 --> 04:07:48.280
真是令人着迷
That really is fascinating.

04:07:48.360 --> 04:07:51.120
不过还要等许多年
Although we've got many years to go before virtual reality

04:07:51.200 --> 04:07:53.120
虚拟现实才能真正变为现实
becomes actual reality.

04:07:53.400 --> 04:07:55.400
-克里斯宾  -谢谢 莱斯莉
-Crispin.  -Thanks, Leslie.

04:07:56.120 --> 04:07:59.720
六个月前 让我们感到震惊的
Now, six months ago, we were shocked to hear of the murder

04:07:59.800 --> 04:08:02.200
是听闻著名程序师科林·里特曼被杀
of famed programmer Colin Ritman,

04:08:02.280 --> 04:08:06.200
他创造了 金属头、鼻子跳水等诸多游戏
creator of Metl Hedd, Nohzdyve, and many other games.

04:08:06.400 --> 04:08:09.040
今天 凶手终于伏法
Today, his murderer is behind bars.

04:08:09.120 --> 04:08:11.240
但这一罪行原本可以避免吗？
But could the crime have been prevented?

04:08:11.840 --> 04:08:15.080
去年十月 塔克软件还势头汹汹
In October of last year, Tuckersoft was riding high,

04:08:15.160 --> 04:08:17.720
一系列热门产品占据榜首
with a string of hits topping the charts

04:08:17.800 --> 04:08:21.720
大家对其圣诞大作《潘达斯奈基》的 期待也不断走高
and a mounting anticipation for their big Christmas release, Bandersnatch.

04:08:22.040 --> 04:08:24.040
但《潘达斯奈基》流产了
But Bandersnatch never appeared,

04:08:24.120 --> 04:08:27.640
因为游戏创作者 19岁的斯蒂芬·巴特勒被逮捕
following the arrest and subsequent murder charge against its creator,

04:08:27.880 --> 04:08:30.120
并面临谋杀指控
19-year-old Stefan Butler,

04:08:30.200 --> 04:08:32.800
指控罪名是谋杀亲生父亲
who stands accused of murdering his father

04:08:32.880 --> 04:08:35.480
以及他的偶像 科林·里特曼

I wasn't to know he couldn't hack it.

04:08:47.040 --> 04:08:48.440
我知道科林死了
I know Colin's dead, but I almost envy him that.

04:08:49.080 --> 04:08:51.080
但我真是羡慕他

04:08:52.560 --> 04:08:54.920
不必处理这一烂摊子
He doesn't have to deal with all this.

04:08:56.120 --> 04:08:59.280
今天 塔克公司永远关上了大门

《潘达斯奈基》无处可寻
And there was no sign of Bandersnatch.

04:10:35.680 --> 04:10:38.600
我就不用了 不过谢谢了
No, I'm alright. Thanks, though.

04:10:41.600 --> 04:10:43.560
刚刚只是想让你有选择
Just thought I'd give you the choice.

04:11:02.320 --> 04:11:03.600
别忘了喝茶
-Don't forget your tea.  -Cheers.

04:11:04.480 --> 04:11:05.320
谢谢

04:11:32.880 --> 04:11:34.280
你做了什么？
What have you done?

04:11:36.360 --> 04:11:37.720
我替你做了选择
I chose for you.

04:11:39.960 --> 04:11:41.200
你不介意吧？
Are you OK with that?

04:11:42.280 --> 04:11:43.120
不介意
Yeah.

04:12:12.280 --> 04:12:14.280
人们以为只有一种现实
People think there's one reality

04:12:14.440 --> 04:12:16.200
但其实有许多种 像根系一样交织
but there's loads of them, all snaking off, like roots.

04:12:16.280 --> 04:12:18.920
我们在一条路线上的行为 会影响到其他路线
And what you do on one path affects what happens on the other paths.

04:12:19.320 --> 04:12:20.960
时间是一种构造
Time is a construct.

04:12:21.040 --> 04:12:24.160
大家以为无法回到过去 改变事情 但其实可以
People think you can't go back and change things, but you can.

04:12:24.240 --> 04:12:25.400
记忆闪回就是这种情况
That's what flashbacks are.

04:12:25.680 --> 04:12:28.360
它们就是邀请人回到过去 做出不一样的抉择
They're invitations to go back and make different choices.

04:12:28.440 --> 04:12:31.440
你在做决定时 以为是自己做出的决定 并非如此
When you make a decision, you think it's you doing it, but it's not.

04:12:31.520 --> 04:12:34.280
而是那些与我们世界相连接的灵魂
It's the spirit out there that's connected to our world

04:12:34.600 --> 04:12:38.760
决定着我们要做什么 我们只要随波逐流就好
that decides what we do and we just have to go along for the ride.

04:12:39.880 --> 04:12:41.720
镜子让人穿行时间
Mirrors let you move through time.

04:12:42.360 --> 04:12:43.440
政府监控着大家
The government monitors people,

04:12:44.160 --> 04:12:46.040
花钱雇人假装你的亲戚
they pay people to pretend to be your relatives,

04:12:46.680 --> 04:12:49.240
在你食物里下药 拍摄你
and they put drugs in your food and they film you

04:12:49.840 --> 04:12:51.520
每个游戏里都有讯息
There's messages in every game.

04:12:51.920 --> 04:12:54.240
比如吃豆人 你知道游戏名PAC代表什么吗？
Like Pac-Man, do you know what PAC stands for?

04:12:55.280 --> 04:12:57.480
PAC即“规划与控制”
P-A-C. Program and Control.

04:12:57.760 --> 04:12:59.400
吃豆人其实就是规划与控制者
He's Program and Control Man.

04:13:00.560 --> 04:13:01.400
整个游戏都是一种隐喻
The whole thing's a metaphor.

04:13:01.840 --> 04:13:04.520
他以为自己有自由意志 但其实是困在迷宫里
He thinks he's got free will but really, he's trapped in a maze,

04:13:04.880 --> 04:13:06.840
困在体系里 只能吃吃吃
in a system, all he can do is consume,

04:13:06.920 --> 04:13:09.080
追逐他的恶魔 大概是他假想出来的
he's pursued by demons that are probably just in his own head.

04:13:09.600 --> 04:13:12.160
就算他从迷宫一侧逃离出来了
And even if he does manage to escape by slipping out one side of the maze,

04:13:12.560 --> 04:13:14.600
又会发生什么？ 他马上又从另一侧回到了迷宫里
what happens? He comes right back in the other side.

04:13:15.320 --> 04:13:16.480
大家以为这是个开心的游戏
People think it's a happy game,

04:13:16.840 --> 04:13:19.640
但并非如此 那是个噩梦世界
it's not a happy game, it's a fucking nightmare world

04:13:19.720 --> 04:13:22.000
最糟糕的是 那世界是真实的 我们都活在其中
and the worst thing is it's real and we live in it.

04:13:22.520 --> 04:13:23.720
全是代码
It's all a code.

04:13:24.040 --> 04:13:26.040
仔细听的话 能听到数字
If you listen closely, you can hear the numbers.

04:13:27.800 --> 04:13:30.280
宇宙有一张流程图 决定了你可以去哪
There's a cosmic flowchart that dictates where you can

04:13:30.880 --> 04:13:32.560
不可以去哪
and where you can't go.

04:13:33.840 --> 04:13:36.640
我已经给了你这份知识 让你自由了
I've given you the knowledge. I've set you free.

04:13:39.080 --> 04:13:40.040
你明白吗？
Do you understand?

04:13:42.440 --> 04:13:43.440
也许吧
Maybe.

04:13:45.480 --> 04:13:46.440
嗯 算是吧
Yes. Sort of.

04:13:46.920 --> 04:13:48.320
我让你看看我是什么意思
I'll show you what I mean.

04:13:49.960 --> 04:13:51.080
跟我来
Come with me.

04:13:59.400 --> 04:14:00.960
我们在一条路线上
We're on one path.

04:14:01.680 --> 04:14:03.160
现在的我和你
Right now, me and you.

04:14:04.200 --> 04:14:06.640
一条路线如何终结并不重要
And how one path ends is immaterial.

04:14:07.000 --> 04:14:12.560
重要的是我们在这条路线上的决定 对整体造成的影响
It's how our decisions along that path affect the whole that matters.

04:14:13.360 --> 04:14:14.600
你相信我吗？
Do you believe me?

04:14:17.240 --> 04:14:19.760
-不知道  -我证明给你看
-I don't know.  -I'll prove it.

04:14:20.760 --> 04:14:24.000
我们中的一个人过去
One of us is going over.

04:14:25.440 --> 04:14:26.320
过去那边
Over there.

04:14:30.800 --> 04:14:31.800
你会死的
You'd die. You'd die.

04:14:32.680 --> 04:14:34.080
不重要
It wouldn't matter because there are other timelines, Stefan.

04:14:34.520 --> 04:14:36.680
因为还有其他时间线 斯蒂芬

04:14:37.520 --> 04:14:39.840
你看到吃豆人死过多少次了？
How many times have you watched Pac-Man die?

04:14:40.520 --> 04:14:41.800
对他没什么影响
Doesn't bother him.

04:14:43.080 --> 04:14:44.400
他重新来过就好
He just tries again.

04:14:45.440 --> 04:14:46.680
我们俩之间的一个人要跳
One of us is jumping.

04:14:47.720 --> 04:14:49.080
是谁？
So, who's it going to be?

04:14:54.680 --> 04:14:56.400
上面凉风习习
There's a nice breeze up here.

04:14:59.720 --> 04:15:00.720
来吧
So come on.

04:15:02.160 --> 04:15:03.560
我们俩谁跳？
Which one of us is jumping?

04:15:09.480 --> 04:15:11.360
（微游戏）

04:15:11.440 --> 04:15:14.560
所以 今日的线框模型
So, that's how the wireframe models of today

04:15:14.640 --> 04:15:17.760
可能会成为好莱坞未来的娱乐
might provide the Hollywood entertainment of the future.

04:15:18.040 --> 04:15:19.040
克里斯宾
-Crispin.  -Thanks, Leslie.

04:15:19.160 --> 04:15:20.320
谢谢 莱斯莉

04:15:20.960 --> 04:15:24.800
昨日 在数周的争议和猜测之后
Now, yesterday, following weeks of controversy and speculation,

04:15:24.880 --> 04:15:29.000
塔克软件游戏公司宣布被行政接管
games company Tuckersoft announced it's going into administration.

04:15:29.080 --> 04:15:30.200
哪里出问题了呢？
So, what went wrong?

04:15:30.960 --> 04:15:34.000
仅仅六个月前 塔克软件还势头汹汹
Just six months ago, Tuckersoft was riding high,

04:15:34.080 --> 04:15:36.400
一系列热门产品占据榜首
with a string of hits topping the charts

04:15:36.480 --> 04:15:40.480
大家对其圣诞大作《潘达斯奈基》的 期待也不断走高
and mounting anticipation for their big Christmas release, Bandersnatch.

04:15:40.960 --> 04:15:43.000
但《潘达斯奈基》流产了
But Bandersnatch never appeared,

04:15:43.080 --> 04:15:46.560
因为游戏创作者 19岁的斯蒂芬·巴特勒被逮捕
following the arrest and subsequent murder charge against its creator,

04:15:46.760 --> 04:15:49.160
并面临谋杀指控
19-year-old Stefan Butler,

04:15:49.240 --> 04:15:51.560
指控罪名是在心理崩溃后
who stands accused of murdering his father

04:15:51.640 --> 04:15:53.520
谋杀了亲生父亲
following a psychological breakdown.

04:15:53.600 --> 04:15:56.200
这使大家质疑
This has raised questions about the judgment

04:15:56.280 --> 04:15:59.000
塔克软件老板莫汗·塔克尔的判断力
of Tuckersoft boss, Mohan Thakur.

04:15:59.480 --> 04:16:02.320
是他想一个人做 是他的决定
It was his idea to do it alone. His decision.

04:16:02.480 --> 04:16:04.320
我也不知道他干不来
I wasn't to know he couldn't hack it.

04:16:04.640 --> 04:16:06.400
我知道他父亲死了
I mean, I know his dad's dead, rest his soul,

04:16:07.000 --> 04:16:08.240
愿他安息

04:16:08.520 --> 04:16:10.240
但我也是受害者
but I'm a victim, too. Let's try to not forget that.

04:16:10.320 --> 04:16:12.160
不要忘记这一点

04:16:12.480 --> 04:16:16.640
塔克软件另一位门生 著名程序师科林·里特曼
Another Tuckersoft protÃ©gÃ©, famed programmer Colin Ritman,

04:16:16.720 --> 04:16:21.240
认为可以从巴特勒失控事件中 学到重要的教训
believes there are important lessons to be learned from Butler's unravelling.

04:16:21.560 --> 04:16:24.160
如果斯蒂芬能听到你说话 你会对他说什么？
What would you say to Stefan, if he could hear you?

04:16:25.360 --> 04:16:26.920
我会说 再试一次
I'd say try again.

04:16:27.880 --> 04:16:28.840
但他在监狱里
But he's in prison.

04:16:30.000 --> 04:16:31.680
只是在这条人生而已
Only in this life.

04:16:32.240 --> 04:16:34.920
采访不久后 科林·里特曼
Shortly after this interview, Colin Ritman was arrested

04:16:35.000 --> 04:16:37.240
因持有管制物品而被逮捕
for possession of controlled substances.

04:16:37.320 --> 04:16:39.800
塔克公司永远关上了大门
Tuckersoft closed its doors for good. And there was no sign of Bandersnatch.

04:16:40.080 --> 04:16:42.880
《潘达斯奈基》无处可寻

04:16:58.440 --> 04:17:01.120
够娱乐了吗 心理变态？
How's that for entertainment, you psychiatric fuck?

04:17:02.160 --> 04:17:04.200
让你一天都很不爽吧 是不是？
Fucked your day up good and proper, didn't we?

04:17:04.280 --> 04:17:07.000
我和来自未来的朋友！
Me and my friend from the future!

04:17:15.120 --> 04:17:16.040
考虑到这一点
With that in mind, I think it's important you stay on the pharmaceutical path

04:17:16.640 --> 04:17:18.760
我觉得你最好还是继续用药

04:17:18.840 --> 04:17:20.200
至少在未来几个月
at least for the next few months.

04:17:20.760 --> 04:17:23.120
我稍微提高剂量
I'm upping the dosage slightly.

04:17:25.800 --> 04:17:26.880
斯蒂芬
Stefan.

04:17:27.680 --> 04:17:28.920
不要把这视为挫折
Don't see this as a setback.

04:17:30.000 --> 04:17:32.120
你并不孤单 我们一起面对
You're not alone. We're in it together.

04:17:33.480 --> 04:17:36.640
我为人人 人人…
One for all, and all...

04:17:38.800 --> 04:17:39.840
为我
For one.

04:17:44.080 --> 04:17:46.880
有情况就给我打电话
If anything happens, just call me.

04:17:47.320 --> 04:17:48.640
你知道号码
You know the number.

04:17:50.000 --> 04:17:52.000
（房间3 海恩斯医生）

04:17:55.120 --> 04:17:56.040
怎么样？
How was it?

04:17:57.560 --> 04:17:58.560
还好
It was fine.

04:18:01.160 --> 04:18:02.120
吸气 呼气
Breathe. In, out.

04:18:03.000 --> 04:18:04.280
呼吸
Breathe.

04:18:04.760 --> 04:18:05.760
呼吸

04:18:19.280 --> 04:18:21.600
-不好  -不好？
-No.  -No?

04:18:23.360 --> 04:18:24.440
那小子给我胡闹
The boy's a clown.

04:18:24.920 --> 04:18:26.280
混账东西
Well, tough tit-holes.

04:18:26.360 --> 04:18:28.600
你签了合同 别给我犯傻
You signed a contract, so don't be a pillock.

04:18:28.680 --> 04:18:29.600
想让我去收拾你吗？
Do you want me go down there?

04:18:29.880 --> 04:18:31.000
给我抓紧点
Pull your finger out. I expect it by the end of today. Sayonara!

04:18:31.080 --> 04:18:33.960
今天结束前交工 再见！

04:18:37.760 --> 04:18:41.440
-永远不要催一个艺术家  -别说废话
-Never rush an artist.  -Oh, blow it out your bumhole.

04:18:41.640 --> 04:18:44.720
他需要探索所有可能 所有现实
He needs to explore all possibilities. All realities.

04:18:45.160 --> 04:18:47.640
脚别搭在我桌上 这个现实如何？
How about a reality where you get your feet off my table?

04:18:49.200 --> 04:18:51.960
敢对我说“不” 我要给他点颜色看看
Fucking "no." I'll show him fucking "no."

04:19:05.320 --> 04:19:06.600
我们会成为热门产品工厂
We're going to be a hit factory. Like Motown, but for computer games.

04:19:06.880 --> 04:19:09.080
就像电脑游戏界的摩城唱片

04:19:09.160 --> 04:19:10.040
这话 你是第一个听到的人
-You heard it here first.  -Colin Ritman.

我们之前见过
We've met before.

04:19:13.360 --> 04:19:14.600
-你怎么想？  -不
-What's your answer?  -No.

04:19:14.760 --> 04:19:16.680
-很厉害  -和海恩斯医生谈谈
Well done, mate. Speak to Dr. Haynes about it, and listen to her.

04:19:16.920 --> 04:19:17.760
听听她的话

04:19:17.840 --> 04:19:19.760
做得好 斯蒂芬
-Well done, Stefan.  -You sound like my dad.

04:19:20.080 --> 04:19:20.960
你和我爸说的话一样

04:19:21.600 --> 04:19:22.440
哦

04:19:23.160 --> 04:19:27.760
你想谈谈你母亲的遭遇吗？
Would you like to talk about what happened with your mother?

04:19:34.160 --> 04:19:36.800
回顾往事可能会有帮助
It can be helpful to revisit things.

04:19:36.880 --> 04:19:39.240
哪怕你觉得之前已经这样做过
Even if you feel like you've done this before.

04:19:40.920 --> 04:19:44.240
你可能会有新的发现
You might discover something new.

04:19:48.440 --> 04:19:49.840
-潘达什么？  -潘达斯奈基
-Your Bander-what?  -Bandersnatch.

04:19:50.080 --> 04:19:51.280
是你母亲的书吧？
Is that your mother's?

04:19:51.760 --> 04:19:53.800
就像电脑游戏界的摩城唱片
Like Motown, but for computer games.

04:19:54.120 --> 04:19:56.760

-你怎么想？  -不

04:19:58.400 --> 04:20:00.520
-需要一点点疯狂  -太过…
-Bit of madness is what you need.  -It was too...

04:20:00.600 --> 04:20:02.040
-太过？  -太过理想 不像是真的
-Too?  -Good to be true.

04:20:02.320 --> 04:20:04.200
-你来还是不来？  -不去！
-Are you coming or not?  -No!

04:20:04.400 --> 04:20:06.240
因为我 她只能坐晚一点的火车
Because of me she had to catch a later train.

04:20:06.400 --> 04:20:09.440
8点45分的高速列车脱轨…
The 8:45 train derailed at high speed...

04:20:11.320 --> 04:20:12.160
（运行）

04:20:13.240 --> 04:20:17.160
斯蒂芬 我担心你 你在房间里待好几周了
Stefan, I'm worried about you, you've been stuck in your room for weeks.

（函数未定义）

04:20:30.640 --> 04:20:32.760
你坐着一言不发 我也帮不了你
Look, I can't help if you just sit there and don't speak!
